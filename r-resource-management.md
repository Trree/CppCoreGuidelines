# <span id="S-resource"></span>R: Resource management

This section contains rules related to resources.
A resource is anything that must be acquired and (explicitly or implicitly) released, such as memory, file handles, sockets, and locks.
The reason it must be released is typically that it can be in short supply, so even delayed release may do harm.
The fundamental aim is to ensure that we don't leak any resources and that we don't hold a resource longer than we need to.
An entity that is responsible for releasing a resource is called an owner.

There are a few cases where leaks can be acceptable or even optimal:
If you are writing a program that simply produces an output based on an input and the amount of memory needed is proportional to the size of the input, the optimal strategy (for performance and ease of programming) is sometimes simply never to delete anything.
If you have enough memory to handle your largest input, leak away, but be sure to give a good error message if you are wrong.
Here, we ignore such cases.

### <span id="Rr-raii"></span>R.1: Manage resources automatically using resource handles and RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)

##### Reason

To avoid leaks and the complexity of manual resource management.
C++'s language-enforced constructor/destructor symmetry mirrors the symmetry inherent in resource acquire/release function pairs such as `fopen`/`fclose`, `lock`/`unlock`, and `new`/`delete`.
Whenever you deal with a resource that needs paired acquire/release function calls, encapsulate that resource in an object that enforces pairing for you -- acquire the resource in its constructor, and release it in its destructor.

##### Example, bad

Consider:

    void send(X* x, cstring_span destination)
    {
        auto port = open_port(destination);
        my_mutex.lock();
        // ...
        send(port, x);
        // ...
        my_mutex.unlock();
        close_port(port);
        delete x;
    }

In this code, you have to remember to `unlock`, `close_port`, and `delete` on all paths, and do each exactly once.
Further, if any of the code marked `...` throws an exception, then `x` is leaked and `my_mutex` remains locked.

##### Example

Consider:

    void send(unique_ptr<X> x, cstring_span destination)  // x owns the X
    {
        Port port{destination};            // port owns the PortHandle
        lock_guard<mutex> guard{my_mutex}; // guard owns the lock
        // ...
        send(port, x);
        // ...
    } // automatically unlocks my_mutex and deletes the pointer in x

Now all resource cleanup is automatic, performed once on all paths whether or not there is an exception. As a bonus, the function now advertises that it takes over ownership of the pointer.

What is `Port`? A handy wrapper that encapsulates the resource:

    class Port {
        PortHandle port;
    public:
        Port(cstring_span destination) : port{open_port(destination)} { }
        ~Port() { close_port(port); }
        operator PortHandle() { return port; }

        // port handles can't usually be cloned, so disable copying and assignment if necessary
        Port(const Port&) = delete;
        Port& operator=(const Port&) = delete;
    };

##### Note

Where a resource is "ill-behaved" in that it isn't represented as a class with a destructor, wrap it in a class or use [`finally`](#S-gsl)

**See also**: [RAII](#Rr-raii).

### <span id="Rr-use-ptr"></span>R.2: In interfaces, use raw pointers to denote individual objects (only)

##### Reason

Arrays are best represented by a container type (e.g., `vector` (owning)) or a `span` (non-owning).
Such containers and views hold sufficient information to do range checking.

##### Example, bad

    void f(int* p, int n)   // n is the number of elements in p[]
    {
        // ...
        p[2] = 7;   // bad: subscript raw pointer
        // ...
    }

The compiler does not read comments, and without reading other code you do not know whether `p` really points to `n` elements.
Use a `span` instead.

##### Example

    void g(int* p, int fmt)   // print *p using format #fmt
    {
        // ... uses *p and p[0] only ...
    }

##### Exception

C-style strings are passed as single pointers to a zero-terminated sequence of characters.
Use `zstring` rather than `char*` to indicate that you rely on that convention.

##### Note

Many current uses of pointers to a single element could be references.
However, where `nullptr` is a possible value, a reference may not be an reasonable alternative.

##### Enforcement

* Flag pointer arithmetic (including `++`) on a pointer that is not part of a container, view, or iterator.
  This rule would generate a huge number of false positives if applied to an older code base.
* Flag array names passed as simple pointers

### <span id="Rr-ptr"></span>R.3: A raw pointer (a `T*`) is non-owning

##### Reason

There is nothing (in the C++ standard or in most code) to say otherwise and most raw pointers are non-owning.
We want owning pointers identified so that we can reliably and efficiently delete the objects pointed to by owning pointers.

##### Example

    void f()
    {
        int* p1 = new int{7};           // bad: raw owning pointer
        auto p2 = make_unique<int>(7);  // OK: the int is owned by a unique pointer
        // ...
    }

The `unique_ptr` protects against leaks by guaranteeing the deletion of its object (even in the presence of exceptions). The `T*` does not.

##### Example

    template<typename T>
    class X {
        // ...
    public:
        T* p;   // bad: it is unclear whether p is owning or not
        T* q;   // bad: it is unclear whether q is owning or not
    };

We can fix that problem by making ownership explicit:

    template<typename T>
    class X2 {
        // ...
    public:
        owner<T*> p;  // OK: p is owning
        T* q;         // OK: q is not owning
    };

##### Exception

A major class of exception is legacy code, especially code that must remain compilable as C or interface with C and C-style C++ through ABIs.
The fact that there are billions of lines of code that violate this rule against owning `T*`s cannot be ignored.
We'd love to see program transformation tools turning 20-year-old "legacy" code into shiny modern code,
we encourage the development, deployment and use of such tools,
we hope the guidelines will help the development of such tools,
and we even contributed (and contribute) to the research and development in this area.
However, it will take time: "legacy code" is generated faster than we can renovate old code, and so it will be for a few years.

This code cannot all be rewritten (ever assuming good code transformation software), especially not soon.
This problem cannot be solved (at scale) by transforming all owning pointers to `unique_ptr`s and `shared_ptr`s,
partly because we need/use owning "raw pointers" as well as simple pointers in the implementation of our fundamental resource handles.
For example, common `vector` implementations have one owning pointer and two non-owning pointers.
Many ABIs (and essentially all interfaces to C code) use `T*`s, some of them owning.
Some interfaces cannot be simply annotated with `owner` because they need to remain compilable as C
(although this would be a rare good use for a macro, that expands to `owner` in C++ mode only).

##### Note

`owner<T*>` has no default semantics beyond `T*`. It can be used without changing any code using it and without affecting ABIs.
It is simply a indicator to programmers and analysis tools.
For example, if an `owner<T*>` is a member of a class, that class better have a destructor that `delete`s it.

##### Example, bad

Returning a (raw) pointer imposes a life-time management uncertainty on the caller; that is, who deletes the pointed-to object?

    Gadget* make_gadget(int n)
    {
        auto p = new Gadget{n};
        // ...
        return p;
    }

    void caller(int n)
    {
        auto p = make_gadget(n);   // remember to delete p
        // ...
        delete p;
    }

In addition to suffering from the problem from [leak](#???), this adds a spurious allocation and deallocation operation, and is needlessly verbose. If Gadget is cheap to move out of a function (i.e., is small or has an efficient move operation), just return it "by value" (see ["out" return values](#Rf-out)):

    Gadget make_gadget(int n)
    {
        Gadget g{n};
        // ...
        return g;
    }

##### Note

This rule applies to factory functions.

##### Note

If pointer semantics are required (e.g., because the return type needs to refer to a base class of a class hierarchy (an interface)), return a "smart pointer."

##### Enforcement

* (Simple) Warn on `delete` of a raw pointer that is not an `owner<T>`.
* (Moderate) Warn on failure to either `reset` or explicitly `delete` an `owner<T>` pointer on every code path.
* (Simple) Warn if the return value of `new` is assigned to a raw pointer.
* (Simple) Warn if a function returns an object that was allocated within the function but has a move constructor.
  Suggest considering returning it by value instead.

### <span id="Rr-ref"></span>R.4: A raw reference (a `T&`) is non-owning

##### Reason

There is nothing (in the C++ standard or in most code) to say otherwise and most raw references are non-owning.
We want owners identified so that we can reliably and efficiently delete the objects pointed to by owning pointers.

##### Example

    void f()
    {
        int& r = *new int{7};  // bad: raw owning reference
        // ...
        delete &r;             // bad: violated the rule against deleting raw pointers
    }

**See also**: [The raw pointer rule](#Rr-ptr)

##### Enforcement

See [the raw pointer rule](#Rr-ptr)

### <span id="Rr-scoped"></span>R.5: Prefer scoped objects, don't heap-allocate unnecessarily

##### Reason

A scoped object is a local object, a global object, or a member.
This implies that there is no separate allocation and deallocation cost in excess of that already used for the containing scope or object.
The members of a scoped object are themselves scoped and the scoped object's constructor and destructor manage the members' lifetimes.

##### Example

The following example is inefficient (because it has unnecessary allocation and deallocation), vulnerable to exception throws and returns in the `...` part (leading to leaks), and verbose:

    void f(int n)
    {
        auto p = new Gadget{n};
        // ...
        delete p;
    }

Instead, use a local variable:

    void f(int n)
    {
        Gadget g{n};
        // ...
    }

##### Enforcement

* (Moderate) Warn if an object is allocated and then deallocated on all paths within a function. Suggest it should be a local `auto` stack object instead.
* (Simple) Warn if a local `Unique_ptr` or `Shared_ptr` is not moved, copied, reassigned or `reset` before its lifetime ends.

### <span id="Rr-global"></span>R.6: Avoid non-`const` global variables

##### Reason

Global variables can be accessed from everywhere so they can introduce surprising dependencies between apparently unrelated objects.
They are a notable source of errors.

**Warning**: The initialization of global objects is not totally ordered.
If you use a global object initialize it with a constant.
Note that it is possible to get undefined initialization order even for `const` objects.

##### Exception

A global object is often better than a singleton.

##### Exception

An immutable (`const`) global does not introduce the problems we try to avoid by banning global objects.

##### Enforcement

(??? NM: Obviously we can warn about non-`const` statics ... do we want to?)

## <span id="SS-alloc"></span>R.alloc: Allocation and deallocation

### <span id="Rr-mallocfree"></span>R.10: Avoid `malloc()` and `free()`

##### Reason

 `malloc()` and `free()` do not support construction and destruction, and do not mix well with `new` and `delete`.

##### Example

    class Record {
        int id;
        string name;
        // ...
    };

    void use()
    {
        // p1 may be nullptr
        // *p1 is not initialized; in particular,
        // that string isn't a string, but a string-sized bag of bits
        Record* p1 = static_cast<Record*>(malloc(sizeof(Record)));

        auto p2 = new Record;

        // unless an exception is thrown, *p2 is default initialized
        auto p3 = new(nothrow) Record;
        // p3 may be nullptr; if not, *p3 is default initialized

        // ...

        delete p1;    // error: cannot delete object allocated by malloc()
        free(p2);    // error: cannot free() object allocated by new
    }

In some implementations that `delete` and that `free()` might work, or maybe they will cause run-time errors.

##### Exception

There are applications and sections of code where exceptions are not acceptable.
Some of the best such examples are in life-critical hard real-time code.
Beware that many bans on exception use are based on superstition (bad)
or by concerns for older code bases with unsystematic resource management (unfortunately, but sometimes necessary).
In such cases, consider the `nothrow` versions of `new`.

##### Enforcement

Flag explicit use of `malloc` and `free`.

### <span id="Rr-newdelete"></span>R.11: Avoid calling `new` and `delete` explicitly

##### Reason

The pointer returned by `new` should belong to a resource handle (that can call `delete`).
If the pointer returned by `new` is assigned to a plain/naked pointer, the object can be leaked.

##### Note

In a large program, a naked `delete` (that is a `delete` in application code, rather than part of code devoted to resource management)
is a likely bug: if you have N `delete`s, how can you be certain that you don't need N+1 or N-1?
The bug may be latent: it may emerge only during maintenance.
If you have a naked `new`, you probably need a naked `delete` somewhere, so you probably have a bug.

##### Enforcement

(Simple) Warn on any explicit use of `new` and `delete`. Suggest using `make_unique` instead.

### <span id="Rr-immediate-alloc"></span>R.12: Immediately give the result of an explicit resource allocation to a manager object

##### Reason

If you don't, an exception or a return may lead to a leak.

##### Example, bad

    void f(const string& name)
    {
        FILE* f = fopen(name, "r");          // open the file
        vector<char> buf(1024);
        auto _ = finally([f] { fclose(f); })  // remember to close the file
        // ...
    }

The allocation of `buf` may fail and leak the file handle.

##### Example

    void f(const string& name)
    {
        ifstream f{name};   // open the file
        vector<char> buf(1024);
        // ...
    }

The use of the file handle (in `ifstream`) is simple, efficient, and safe.

##### Enforcement

* Flag explicit allocations used to initialize pointers (problem: how many direct resource allocations can we recognize?)

### <span id="Rr-single-alloc"></span>R.13: Perform at most one explicit resource allocation in a single expression statement

##### Reason

If you perform two explicit resource allocations in one statement, you could leak resources because the order of evaluation of many subexpressions, including function arguments, is unspecified.

##### Example

    void fun(shared_ptr<Widget> sp1, shared_ptr<Widget> sp2);

This `fun` can be called like this:

    // BAD: potential leak
    fun(shared_ptr<Widget>(new Widget(a, b)), shared_ptr<Widget>(new Widget(c, d)));

This is exception-unsafe because the compiler may reorder the two expressions building the function's two arguments.
In particular, the compiler can interleave execution of the two expressions:
Memory allocation (by calling `operator new`) could be done first for both objects, followed by attempts to call the two `Widget` constructors.
If one of the constructor calls throws an exception, then the other object's memory will never be released!

This subtle problem has a simple solution: Never perform more than one explicit resource allocation in a single expression statement.
For example:

    shared_ptr<Widget> sp1(new Widget(a, b)); // Better, but messy
    fun(sp1, new Widget(c, d));

The best solution is to avoid explicit allocation entirely use factory functions that return owning objects:

    fun(make_shared<Widget>(a, b), make_shared<Widget>(c, d)); // Best

Write your own factory wrapper if there is not one already.

##### Enforcement

* Flag expressions with multiple explicit resource allocations (problem: how many direct resource allocations can we recognize?)

### <span id="Rr-ap"></span>R.14: ??? array vs. pointer parameter

##### Reason

An array decays to a pointer, thereby losing its size, opening the opportunity for range errors.

##### Example

    ??? what do we recommend: f(int*[]) or f(int**) ???

**Alternative**: Use `span` to preserve size information.

##### Enforcement

Flag `[]` parameters.

### <span id="Rr-pair"></span>R.15: Always overload matched allocation/deallocation pairs

##### Reason

Otherwise you get mismatched operations and chaos.

##### Example

    class X {
        // ...
        void* operator new(size_t s);
        void operator delete(void*);
        // ...
    };

##### Note

If you want memory that cannot be deallocated, `=delete` the deallocation operation.
Don't leave it undeclared.

##### Enforcement

Flag incomplete pairs.

## <span id="SS-smart"></span>R.smart: Smart pointers

### <span id="Rr-owner"></span>R.20: Use `unique_ptr` or `shared_ptr` to represent ownership

##### Reason

They can prevent resource leaks.

##### Example

Consider:

    void f()
    {
        X x;
        X* p1 { new X };              // see also ???
        unique_ptr<T> p2 { new X };   // unique ownership; see also ???
        shared_ptr<T> p3 { new X };   // shared ownership; see also ???
    }

This will leak the object used to initialize `p1` (only).

##### Enforcement

(Simple) Warn if the return value of `new` or a function call with return value of pointer type is assigned to a raw pointer.

### <span id="Rr-unique"></span>R.21: Prefer `unique_ptr` over `shared_ptr` unless you need to share ownership

##### Reason

A `unique_ptr` is conceptually simpler and more predictable (you know when destruction happens) and faster (you don't implicitly maintain a use count).

##### Example, bad

This needlessly adds and maintains a reference count.

    void f()
    {
        shared_ptr<Base> base = make_shared<Derived>();
        // use base locally, without copying it -- refcount never exceeds 1
    } // destroy base

##### Example

This is more efficient:

    void f()
    {
        unique_ptr<Base> base = make_unique<Derived>();
        // use base locally
    } // destroy base

##### Enforcement

(Simple) Warn if a function uses a `Shared_ptr` with an object allocated within the function, but never returns the `Shared_ptr` or passes it to a function requiring a `Shared_ptr&`. Suggest using `unique_ptr` instead.

### <span id="Rr-make_shared"></span>R.22: Use `make_shared()` to make `shared_ptr`s

##### Reason

If you first make an object and then give it to a `shared_ptr` constructor, you (most likely) do one more allocation (and later deallocation) than if you use `make_shared()` because the reference counts must be allocated separately from the object.

##### Example

Consider:

    shared_ptr<X> p1 { new X{2} }; // bad
    auto p = make_shared<X>(2);    // good

The `make_shared()` version mentions `X` only once, so it is usually shorter (as well as faster) than the version with the explicit `new`.

##### Enforcement

(Simple) Warn if a `shared_ptr` is constructed from the result of `new` rather than `make_shared`.

### <span id="Rr-make_unique"></span>R.23: Use `make_unique()` to make `unique_ptr`s

##### Reason

For convenience and consistency with `shared_ptr`.

##### Note

`make_unique()` is C++14, but widely available (as well as simple to write).

##### Enforcement

(Simple) Warn if a `unique_ptr` is constructed from the result of `new` rather than `make_unique`.

### <span id="Rr-weak_ptr"></span>R.24: Use `std::weak_ptr` to break cycles of `shared_ptr`s

##### Reason

 `shared_ptr`'s rely on use counting and the use count for a cyclic structure never goes to zero, so we need a mechanism to
be able to destroy a cyclic structure.

##### Example

    ???

##### Note

 ??? (HS: A lot of people say "to break cycles", while I think "temporary shared ownership" is more to the point.)
???(BS: breaking cycles is what you must do; temporarily sharing ownership is how you do it.
You could "temporarily share ownership" simply by using another `shared_ptr`.)

##### Enforcement

??? probably impossible. If we could statically detect cycles, we wouldn't need `weak_ptr`

### <span id="Rr-smartptrparam"></span>R.30: Take smart pointers as parameters only to explicitly express lifetime semantics

##### Reason

Accepting a smart pointer to a `widget` is wrong if the function just needs the `widget` itself.
It should be able to accept any `widget` object, not just ones whose lifetimes are managed by a particular kind of smart pointer.
A function that does not manipulate lifetime should take raw pointers or references instead.

##### Example, bad

    // callee
    void f(shared_ptr<widget>& w)
    {
        // ...
        use(*w); // only use of w -- the lifetime is not used at all
        // ...
    };

    // caller
    shared_ptr<widget> my_widget = /* ... */;
    f(my_widget);

    widget stack_widget;
    f(stack_widget); // error

##### Example, good

    // callee
    void f(widget& w)
    {
        // ...
        use(w);
        // ...
    };

    // caller
    shared_ptr<widget> my_widget = /* ... */;
    f(*my_widget);

    widget stack_widget;
    f(stack_widget); // ok -- now this works

##### Enforcement

* (Simple) Warn if a function takes a parameter of a smart pointer type (that overloads `operator->` or `operator*`) that is copyable but the function only calls any of: `operator*`, `operator->` or `get()`.
  Suggest using a `T*` or `T&` instead.
* Flag a parameter of a smart pointer type (a type that overloads `operator->` or `operator*`) that is copyable/movable but never copied/moved from in the function body, and that is never modified, and that is not passed along to another function that could do so. That means the ownership semantics are not used.
  Suggest using a `T*` or `T&` instead.

### <span id="Rr-smart"></span>R.31: If you have non-`std` smart pointers, follow the basic pattern from `std`

##### Reason

The rules in the following section also work for other kinds of third-party and custom smart pointers and are very useful for diagnosing common smart pointer errors that cause performance and correctness problems.
You want the rules to work on all the smart pointers you use.

Any type (including primary template or specialization) that overloads unary `*` and `->` is considered a smart pointer:

* If it is copyable, it is recognized as a reference-counted `shared_ptr`.
* If it is not copyable, it is recognized as a unique `unique_ptr`.

##### Example

    // use Boost's intrusive_ptr
    #include <boost/intrusive_ptr.hpp>
    void f(boost::intrusive_ptr<widget> p)  // error under rule 'sharedptrparam'
    {
        p->foo();
    }

    // use Microsoft's CComPtr
    #include <atlbase.h>
    void f(CComPtr<widget> p)               // error under rule 'sharedptrparam'
    {
        p->foo();
    }

Both cases are an error under the [`sharedptrparam` guideline](#Rr-smartptrparam):
`p` is a `Shared_ptr`, but nothing about its sharedness is used here and passing it by value is a silent pessimization;
these functions should accept a smart pointer only if they need to participate in the widget's lifetime management. Otherwise they should accept a `widget*`, if it can be `nullptr`. Otherwise, and ideally, the function should accept a `widget&`.
These smart pointers match the `Shared_ptr` concept, so these guideline enforcement rules work on them out of the box and expose this common pessimization.

### <span id="Rr-uniqueptrparam"></span>R.32: Take a `unique_ptr<widget>` parameter to express that a function assumes ownership of a `widget`

##### Reason

Using `unique_ptr` in this way both documents and enforces the function call's ownership transfer.

##### Example

    void sink(unique_ptr<widget>); // consumes the widget

    void uses(widget*);            // just uses the widget

##### Example, bad

    void thinko(const unique_ptr<widget>&); // usually not what you want

##### Enforcement

* (Simple) Warn if a function takes a `Unique_ptr<T>` parameter by lvalue reference and does not either assign to it or call `reset()` on it on at least one code path. Suggest taking a `T*` or `T&` instead.
* (Simple) ((Foundation)) Warn if a function takes a `Unique_ptr<T>` parameter by reference to `const`. Suggest taking a `const T*` or `const T&` instead.

### <span id="Rr-reseat"></span>R.33: Take a `unique_ptr<widget>&` parameter to express that a function reseats the`widget`

##### Reason

Using `unique_ptr` in this way both documents and enforces the function call's reseating semantics.

##### Note

"reseat" means "making a pointer or a smart pointer refer to a different object."

##### Example

    void reseat(unique_ptr<widget>&); // "will" or "might" reseat pointer

##### Example, bad

    void thinko(const unique_ptr<widget>&); // usually not what you want

##### Enforcement

* (Simple) Warn if a function takes a `Unique_ptr<T>` parameter by lvalue reference and does not either assign to it or call `reset()` on it on at least one code path. Suggest taking a `T*` or `T&` instead.
* (Simple) ((Foundation)) Warn if a function takes a `Unique_ptr<T>` parameter by reference to `const`. Suggest taking a `const T*` or `const T&` instead.

### <span id="Rr-sharedptrparam-owner"></span>R.34: Take a `shared_ptr<widget>` parameter to express that a function is part owner

##### Reason

This makes the function's ownership sharing explicit.

##### Example, good

    void share(shared_ptr<widget>);            // share -- "will" retain refcount

    void may_share(const shared_ptr<widget>&); // "might" retain refcount

    void reseat(shared_ptr<widget>&);          // "might" reseat ptr

##### Enforcement

* (Simple) Warn if a function takes a `Shared_ptr<T>` parameter by lvalue reference and does not either assign to it or call `reset()` on it on at least one code path. Suggest taking a `T*` or `T&` instead.
* (Simple) ((Foundation)) Warn if a function takes a `Shared_ptr<T>` by value or by reference to `const` and does not copy or move it to another `Shared_ptr` on at least one code path. Suggest taking a `T*` or `T&` instead.
* (Simple) ((Foundation)) Warn if a function takes a `Shared_ptr<T>` by rvalue reference. Suggesting taking it by value instead.

### <span id="Rr-sharedptrparam"></span>R.35: Take a `shared_ptr<widget>&` parameter to express that a function might reseat the shared pointer

##### Reason

This makes the function's reseating explicit.

##### Note

"reseat" means "making a reference or a smart pointer refer to a different object."

##### Example, good

    void share(shared_ptr<widget>);            // share -- "will" retain refcount

    void reseat(shared_ptr<widget>&);          // "might" reseat ptr

    void may_share(const shared_ptr<widget>&); // "might" retain refcount

##### Enforcement

* (Simple) Warn if a function takes a `Shared_ptr<T>` parameter by lvalue reference and does not either assign to it or call `reset()` on it on at least one code path. Suggest taking a `T*` or `T&` instead.
* (Simple) ((Foundation)) Warn if a function takes a `Shared_ptr<T>` by value or by reference to `const` and does not copy or move it to another `Shared_ptr` on at least one code path. Suggest taking a `T*` or `T&` instead.
* (Simple) ((Foundation)) Warn if a function takes a `Shared_ptr<T>` by rvalue reference. Suggesting taking it by value instead.

### <span id="Rr-sharedptrparam-const"></span>R.36: Take a `const shared_ptr<widget>&` parameter to express that it might retain a reference count to the object ???

##### Reason

This makes the function's ??? explicit.

##### Example, good

    void share(shared_ptr<widget>);            // share -- "will" retain refcount

    void reseat(shared_ptr<widget>&);          // "might" reseat ptr

    void may_share(const shared_ptr<widget>&); // "might" retain refcount

##### Enforcement

* (Simple) Warn if a function takes a `Shared_ptr<T>` parameter by lvalue reference and does not either assign to it or call `reset()` on it on at least one code path. Suggest taking a `T*` or `T&` instead.
* (Simple) ((Foundation)) Warn if a function takes a `Shared_ptr<T>` by value or by reference to `const` and does not copy or move it to another `Shared_ptr` on at least one code path. Suggest taking a `T*` or `T&` instead.
* (Simple) ((Foundation)) Warn if a function takes a `Shared_ptr<T>` by rvalue reference. Suggesting taking it by value instead.

### <span id="Rr-smartptrget"></span>R.37: Do not pass a pointer or reference obtained from an aliased smart pointer

##### Reason

Violating this rule is the number one cause of losing reference counts and finding yourself with a dangling pointer.
Functions should prefer to pass raw pointers and references down call chains.
At the top of the call tree where you obtain the raw pointer or reference from a smart pointer that keeps the object alive.
You need to be sure that the smart pointer cannot inadvertently be reset or reassigned from within the call tree below.

##### Note

To do this, sometimes you need to take a local copy of a smart pointer, which firmly keeps the object alive for the duration of the function and the call tree.

##### Example

Consider this code:

    // global (static or heap), or aliased local ...
    shared_ptr<widget> g_p = ...;

    void f(widget& w)
    {
        g();
        use(w);  // A
    }

    void g()
    {
        g_p = ...; // oops, if this was the last shared_ptr to that widget, destroys the widget
    }

The following should not pass code review:

    void my_code()
    {
        // BAD: passing pointer or reference obtained from a nonlocal smart pointer
        //      that could be inadvertently reset somewhere inside f or it callees
        f(*g_p);

        // BAD: same reason, just passing it as a "this" pointer
         g_p->func();
    }

The fix is simple -- take a local copy of the pointer to "keep a ref count" for your call tree:

    void my_code()
    {
        // cheap: 1 increment covers this entire function and all the call trees below us
        auto pin = g_p;

        // GOOD: passing pointer or reference obtained from a local unaliased smart pointer
        f(*pin);

        // GOOD: same reason
        pin->func();
    }

##### Enforcement

* (Simple) Warn if a pointer or reference obtained from a smart pointer variable (`Unique_ptr` or `Shared_ptr`) that is nonlocal, or that is local but potentially aliased, is used in a function call. If the smart pointer is a `Shared_ptr` then suggest taking a local copy of the smart pointer and obtain a pointer or reference from that instead.
