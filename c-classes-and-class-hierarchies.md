# <a name="S-class"></a>C: Classes and Class Hierarchies

A class is a user-defined type, for which a programmer can define the representation, operations, and interfaces.
Class hierarchies are used to organize related classes into hierarchical structures.

Class rule summary:

* [C.1: Organize related data into structures (`struct`s or `class`es)](#Rc-org)
* [C.2: Use `class` if the class has an invariant; use `struct` if the data members can vary independently](#Rc-struct)
* [C.3: Represent the distinction between an interface and an implementation using a class](#Rc-interface)
* [C.4: Make a function a member only if it needs direct access to the representation of a class](#Rc-member)
* [C.5: Place helper functions in the same namespace as the class they support](#Rc-helper)
* [C.7: Don't define a class or enum and declare a variable of its type in the same statement](#Rc-standalone)
* [C.8: Use `class` rather than `struct` if any member is non-public](#Rc-class)
* [C.9: Minimize exposure of members](#Rc-private)

Subsections:

* [C.concrete: Concrete types](#SS-concrete)
* [C.ctor: Constructors, assignments, and destructors](#S-ctor)
* [C.con: Containers and other resource handles](#SS-containers)
* [C.lambdas: Function objects and lambdas](#SS-lambdas)
* [C.hier: Class hierarchies (OOP)](#SS-hier)
* [C.over: Overloading and overloaded operators](#SS-overload)
* [C.union: Unions](#SS-union)

### <a name="Rc-org"></a>C.1: Organize related data into structures (`struct`s or `class`es)

##### Reason

Ease of comprehension. If data is related (for fundamental reasons), that fact should be reflected in code.

##### Example

    void draw(int x, int y, int x2, int y2);  // BAD: unnecessary implicit relationships
    void draw(Point from, Point to);          // better

##### Note

A simple class without virtual functions implies no space or time overhead.

##### Note

From a language perspective `class` and `struct` differ only in the default visibility of their members.

##### Enforcement

Probably impossible. Maybe a heuristic looking for data items used together is possible.

### <a name="Rc-struct"></a>C.2: Use `class` if the class has an invariant; use `struct` if the data members can vary independently

##### Reason

Readability.
Ease of comprehension.
The use of `class` alerts the programmer to the need for an invariant.
This is a useful convention.

##### Note

An invariant is a logical condition for the members of an object that a constructor must establish for the public member functions to assume.
After the invariant is established (typically by a constructor) every member function can be called for the object.
An invariant can be stated informally (e.g., in a comment) or more formally using `Expects`.

If all data members can vary independently of each other, no invariant is possible.

##### Example

    struct Pair {  // the members can vary independently
        string name;
        int volume;
    };

but:

    class Date {
    public:
        // validate that {yy, mm, dd} is a valid date and initialize
        Date(int yy, Month mm, char dd);
        // ...
    private:
        int y;
        Month m;
        char d;    // day
    };

##### Note

If a class has any `private` data, a user cannot completely initialize an object without the use of a constructor.
Hence, the class definer will provide a constructor and must specify its meaning.
This effectively means the definer need to define an invariant.

* See also [define a class with private data as `class`](#Rc-class).
* See also [Prefer to place the interface first in a class](#Rl-order).
* See also [minimize exposure of members](#Rc-private).
* See also [Avoid `protected` data](#Rh-protected).

##### Enforcement

Look for `struct`s with all data private and `class`es with public members.

### <a name="Rc-interface"></a>C.3: Represent the distinction between an interface and an implementation using a class

##### Reason

An explicit distinction between interface and implementation improves readability and simplifies maintenance.

##### Example

    class Date {
        // ... some representation ...
    public:
        Date();
        // validate that {yy, mm, dd} is a valid date and initialize
        Date(int yy, Month mm, char dd);

        int day() const;
        Month month() const;
        // ...
    };

For example, we can now change the representation of a `Date` without affecting its users (recompilation is likely, though).

##### Note

Using a class in this way to represent the distinction between interface and implementation is of course not the only way.
For example, we can use a set of declarations of freestanding functions in a namespace, an abstract base class, or a template function with concepts to represent an interface.
The most important issue is to explicitly distinguish between an interface and its implementation "details."
Ideally, and typically, an interface is far more stable than its implementation(s).

##### Enforcement

???

### <a name="Rc-member"></a>C.4: Make a function a member only if it needs direct access to the representation of a class

##### Reason

Less coupling than with member functions, fewer functions that can cause trouble by modifying object state, reduces the number of functions that needs to be modified after a change in representation.

##### Example

    class Date {
        // ... relatively small interface ...
    };

    // helper functions:
    Date next_weekday(Date);
    bool operator==(Date, Date);

The "helper functions" have no need for direct access to the representation of a `Date`.

##### Note

This rule becomes even better if C++ gets ["uniform function call"](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0251r0.pdf).

##### Exception

The language requires `virtual` functions to be members, and not all `virtual` functions directly access data.
In particular, members of an abstract class rarely do.

Note [multi-methods](https://parasol.tamu.edu/~yuriys/papers/OMM10.pdf).

##### Exception

The language requires operators `=`, `()`, `[]`, and `->` to be members.

###### Exception

An overload set may have some members that do not directly access `private` data:

    class Foobar {
        void foo(int x)    { /* manipulate private data */ }
        void foo(double x) { foo(std::round(x)); }
        // ...
    private:
        // ...
    };

Similarly, a set of functions may be designed to be used in a chain:

    x.scale(0.5).rotate(45).set_color(Color::red);

Typically, some but not all of such functions directly access `private` data.

##### Enforcement

* Look for non-`virtual` member functions that do not touch data members directly.
The snag is that many member functions that do not need to touch data members directly do.
* Ignore `virtual` functions.
* Ignore functions that are part of an overload set out of which at least one function accesses `private` members.
* Ignore functions returning `this`.

### <a name="Rc-helper"></a>C.5: Place helper functions in the same namespace as the class they support

##### Reason

A helper function is a function (usually supplied by the writer of a class) that does not need direct access to the representation of the class, yet is seen as part of the useful interface to the class.
Placing them in the same namespace as the class makes their relationship to the class obvious and allows them to be found by argument dependent lookup.

##### Example

    namespace Chrono { // here we keep time-related services

        class Time { /* ... */ };
        class Date { /* ... */ };

        // helper functions:
        bool operator==(Date, Date);
        Date next_weekday(Date);
        // ...
    }

##### Note

This is especially important for [overloaded operators](#Ro-namespace).

##### Enforcement

* Flag global functions taking argument types from a single namespace.

### <a name="Rc-standalone"></a>C.7: Don't define a class or enum and declare a variable of its type in the same statement

##### Reason

Mixing a type definition and the definition of another entity in the same declaration is confusing and unnecessary.

##### Example; bad

    struct Data { /*...*/ } data{ /*...*/ };

##### Example; good

    struct Data { /*...*/ };
    Data data{ /*...*/ };

##### Enforcement

* Flag if the `}` of a class or enumeration definition is not followed by a `;`. The `;` is missing.

### <a name="Rc-class"></a>C.8: Use `class` rather than `struct` if any member is non-public

##### Reason

Readability.
To make it clear that something is being hidden/abstracted.
This is a useful convention.

##### Example, bad

    struct Date {
        int d, m;

        Date(int i, Month m);
        // ... lots of functions ...
    private:
        int y;  // year
    };

There is nothing wrong with this code as far as the C++ language rules are concerned,
but nearly everything is wrong from a design perspective.
The private data is hidden far from the public data.
The data is split in different parts of the class declaration.
Different parts of the data have different access.
All of this decreases readability and complicates maintenance.

##### Note

Prefer to place the interface first in a class [see](#Rl-order).

##### Enforcement

Flag classes declared with `struct` if there is a `private` or `public` member.

### <a name="Rc-private"></a>C.9: Minimize exposure of members

##### Reason

Encapsulation.
Information hiding.
Minimize the chance of untended access.
This simplifies maintenance.

##### Example

    ???

##### Note

Prefer the order `public` members before `protected` members before `private` members [see](#Rl-order).

##### Enforcement

Flag protected data.

## <a name="SS-concrete"></a>C.concrete: Concrete types

One ideal for a class is to be a regular type.
That means roughly "behaves like an `int`." A concrete type is the simplest kind of class.
A value of regular type can be copied and the result of a copy is an independent object with the same value as the original.
If a concrete type has both `=` and `==`, `a = b` should result in `a == b` being `true`.
Concrete classes without assignment and equality can be defined, but they are (and should be) rare.
The C++ built-in types are regular, and so are standard-library classes, such as `string`, `vector`, and `map`.
Concrete types are also often referred to as value types to distinguish them from types used as part of a hierarchy.

Concrete type rule summary:

* [C.10: Prefer concrete types over class hierarchies](#Rc-concrete)
* [C.11: Make concrete types regular](#Rc-regular)

### <a name="Rc-concrete"></a>C.10 Prefer concrete types over class hierarchies

##### Reason

A concrete type is fundamentally simpler than a hierarchy:
easier to design, easier to implement, easier to use, easier to reason about, smaller, and faster.
You need a reason (use cases) for using a hierarchy.

##### Example

    class Point1 {
        int x, y;
        // ... operations ...
        // ... no virtual functions ...
    };

    class Point2 {
        int x, y;
        // ... operations, some virtual ...
        virtual ~Point2();
    };

    void use()
    {
        Point1 p11 {1, 2};   // make an object on the stack
        Point1 p12 {p11};    // a copy

        auto p21 = make_unique<Point2>(1, 2);   // make an object on the free store
        auto p22 = p21.clone();                 // make a copy
        // ...
    }

If a class can be part of a hierarchy, we (in real code if not necessarily in small examples) must manipulate its objects through pointers or references.
That implies more memory overhead, more allocations and deallocations, and more run-time overhead to perform the resulting indirections.

##### Note

Concrete types can be stack allocated and be members of other classes.

##### Note

The use of indirection is fundamental for run-time polymorphic interfaces.
The allocation/deallocation overhead is not (that's just the most common case).
We can use a base class as the interface of a scoped object of a derived class.
This is done where dynamic allocation is prohibited (e.g. hard real-time) and to provide a stable interface to some kinds of plug-ins.

##### Enforcement

???

### <a name="Rc-regular"></a>C.11: Make concrete types regular

##### Reason

Regular types are easier to understand and reason about than types that are not regular (irregularities requires extra effort to understand and use).

##### Example

    struct Bundle {
        string name;
        vector<Record> vr;
    };

    bool operator==(const Bundle& a, const Bundle& b)
    {
        return a.name == b.name && a.vr == b.vr;
    }

    Bundle b1 { "my bundle", {r1, r2, r3}};
    Bundle b2 = b1;
    if (!(b1 == b2)) error("impossible!");
    b2.name = "the other bundle";
    if (b1 == b2) error("No!");

In particular, if a concrete type has an assignment also give it an equals operator so that `a = b` implies `a == b`.

##### Enforcement

???

## <a name="S-ctor"></a>C.ctor: Constructors, assignments, and destructors

These functions control the lifecycle of objects: creation, copy, move, and destruction.
Define constructors to guarantee and simplify initialization of classes.

These are *default operations*:

* a default constructor: `X()`
* a copy constructor: `X(const X&)`
* a copy assignment: `operator=(const X&)`
* a move constructor: `X(X&&)`
* a move assignment: `operator=(X&&)`
* a destructor: `~X()`

By default, the compiler defines each of these operations if it is used, but the default can be suppressed.

The default operations are a set of related operations that together implement the lifecycle semantics of an object.
By default, C++ treats classes as value-like types, but not all types are value-like.

Set of default operations rules:

* [C.20: If you can avoid defining any default operations, do](#Rc-zero)
* [C.21: If you define or `=delete` any default operation, define or `=delete` them all](#Rc-five)
* [C.22: Make default operations consistent](#Rc-matched)

Destructor rules:

* [C.30: Define a destructor if a class needs an explicit action at object destruction](#Rc-dtor)
* [C.31: All resources acquired by a class must be released by the class's destructor](#Rc-dtor-release)
* [C.32: If a class has a raw pointer (`T*`) or reference (`T&`), consider whether it might be owning](#Rc-dtor-ptr)
* [C.33: If a class has an owning pointer member, define or `=delete` a destructor](#Rc-dtor-ptr2)
* [C.34: If a class has an owning reference member, define or `=delete` a destructor](#Rc-dtor-ref)
* [C.35: A base class with a virtual function needs a virtual destructor](#Rc-dtor-virtual)
* [C.36: A destructor may not fail](#Rc-dtor-fail)
* [C.37: Make destructors `noexcept`](#Rc-dtor-noexcept)

Constructor rules:

* [C.40: Define a constructor if a class has an invariant](#Rc-ctor)
* [C.41: A constructor should create a fully initialized object](#Rc-complete)
* [C.42: If a constructor cannot construct a valid object, throw an exception](#Rc-throw)
* [C.43: Ensure that a class has a default constructor](#Rc-default0)
* [C.44: Prefer default constructors to be simple and non-throwing](#Rc-default00)
* [C.45: Don't define a default constructor that only initializes data members; use member initializers instead](#Rc-default)
* [C.46: By default, declare single-argument constructors `explicit`](#Rc-explicit)
* [C.47: Define and initialize member variables in the order of member declaration](#Rc-order)
* [C.48: Prefer in-class initializers to member initializers in constructors for constant initializers](#Rc-in-class-initializer)
* [C.49: Prefer initialization to assignment in constructors](#Rc-initialize)
* [C.50: Use a factory function if you need "virtual behavior" during initialization](#Rc-factory)
* [C.51: Use delegating constructors to represent common actions for all constructors of a class](#Rc-delegating)
* [C.52: Use inheriting constructors to import constructors into a derived class that does not need further explicit initialization](#Rc-inheriting)

Copy and move rules:

* [C.60: Make copy assignment non-`virtual`, take the parameter by `const&`, and return by non-`const&`](#Rc-copy-assignment)
* [C.61: A copy operation should copy](#Rc-copy-semantic)
* [C.62: Make copy assignment safe for self-assignment](#Rc-copy-self)
* [C.63: Make move assignment non-`virtual`, take the parameter by `&&`, and return by non-`const&`](#Rc-move-assignment)
* [C.64: A move operation should move and leave its source in a valid state](#Rc-move-semantic)
* [C.65: Make move assignment safe for self-assignment](#Rc-move-self)
* [C.66: Make move operations `noexcept`](#Rc-move-noexcept)
* [C.67: A base class should suppress copying, and provide a virtual `clone` instead if "copying" is desired](#Rc-copy-virtual)

Other default operations rules:

* [C.80: Use `=default` if you have to be explicit about using the default semantics](#Rc-eqdefault)
* [C.81: Use `=delete` when you want to disable default behavior (without wanting an alternative)](#Rc-delete)
* [C.82: Don't call virtual functions in constructors and destructors](#Rc-ctor-virtual)
* [C.83: For value-like types, consider providing a `noexcept` swap function](#Rc-swap)
* [C.84: A `swap` may not fail](#Rc-swap-fail)
* [C.85: Make `swap` `noexcept`](#Rc-swap-noexcept)
* [C.86: Make `==` symmetric with respect of operand types and `noexcept`](#Rc-eq)
* [C.87: Beware of `==` on base classes](#Rc-eq-base)
* [C.89: Make a `hash` `noexcept`](#Rc-hash)

## <a name="SS-defop"></a>C.defop: Default Operations

By default, the language supplies the default operations with their default semantics.
However, a programmer can disable or replace these defaults.

### <a name="Rc-zero"></a>C.20: If you can avoid defining default operations, do

##### Reason

It's the simplest and gives the cleanest semantics.

##### Example

    struct Named_map {
    public:
        // ... no default operations declared ...
    private:
        string name;
        map<int, int> rep;
    };

    Named_map nm;        // default construct
    Named_map nm2 {nm};  // copy construct

Since `std::map` and `string` have all the special functions, no further work is needed.

##### Note

This is known as "the rule of zero".

##### Enforcement

(Not enforceable) While not enforceable, a good static analyzer can detect patterns that indicate a possible improvement to meet this rule.
For example, a class with a (pointer, size) pair of member and a destructor that `delete`s the pointer could probably be converted to a `vector`.

### <a name="Rc-five"></a>C.21: If you define or `=delete` any default operation, define or `=delete` them all

##### Reason

The semantics of the special functions are closely related, so if one needs to be non-default, the odds are that others need modification too.

##### Example, bad

    struct M2 {   // bad: incomplete set of default operations
    public:
        // ...
        // ... no copy or move operations ...
        ~M2() { delete[] rep; }
    private:
        pair<int, int>* rep;  // zero-terminated set of pairs
    };

    void use()
    {
        M2 x;
        M2 y;
        // ...
        x = y;   // the default assignment
        // ...
    }

Given that "special attention" was needed for the destructor (here, to deallocate), the likelihood that copy and move assignment (both will implicitly destroy an object) are correct is low (here, we would get double deletion).

##### Note

This is known as "the rule of five" or "the rule of six", depending on whether you count the default constructor.

##### Note

If you want a default implementation of a default operation (while defining another), write `=default` to show you're doing so intentionally for that function.
If you don't want a default operation, suppress it with `=delete`.

##### Note

Compilers enforce much of this rule and ideally warn about any violation.

##### Note

Relying on an implicitly generated copy operation in a class with a destructor is deprecated.

##### Enforcement

(Simple) A class should have a declaration (even a `=delete` one) for either all or none of the special functions.

### <a name="Rc-matched"></a>C.22: Make default operations consistent

##### Reason

The default operations are conceptually a matched set. Their semantics are interrelated.
Users will be surprised if copy/move construction and copy/move assignment do logically different things. Users will be surprised if constructors and destructors do not provide a consistent view of resource management. Users will be surprised if copy and move don't reflect the way constructors and destructors work.

##### Example, bad

    class Silly {   // BAD: Inconsistent copy operations
        class Impl {
            // ...
        };
        shared_ptr<Impl> p;
    public:
        Silly(const Silly& a) : p{a.p} { *p = *a.p; }   // deep copy
        Silly& operator=(const Silly& a) { p = a.p; }   // shallow copy
        // ...
    };

These operations disagree about copy semantics. This will lead to confusion and bugs.

##### Enforcement

* (Complex) A copy/move constructor and the corresponding copy/move assignment operator should write to the same member variables at the same level of dereference.
* (Complex) Any member variables written in a copy/move constructor should also be initialized by all other constructors.
* (Complex) If a copy/move constructor performs a deep copy of a member variable, then the destructor should modify the member variable.
* (Complex) If a destructor is modifying a member variable, that member variable should be written in any copy/move constructors or assignment operators.

## <a name="SS-dtor"></a>C.dtor: Destructors

"Does this class need a destructor?" is a surprisingly powerful design question.
For most classes the answer is "no" either because the class holds no resources or because destruction is handled by [the rule of zero](#Rc-zero);
that is, its members can take care of themselves as concerns destruction.
If the answer is "yes", much of the design of the class follows (see [the rule of five](#Rc-five)).

### <a name="Rc-dtor"></a>C.30: Define a destructor if a class needs an explicit action at object destruction

##### Reason

A destructor is implicitly invoked at the end of an object's lifetime.
If the default destructor is sufficient, use it.
Only define a non-default destructor if a class needs to execute code that is not already part of its members' destructors.

##### Example

    template<typename A>
    struct final_action {   // slightly simplified
        A act;
        final_action(A a) :act{a} {}
        ~final_action() { act(); }
    };

    template<typename A>
    final_action<A> finally(A act)   // deduce action type
    {
        return final_action<A>{act};
    }

    void test()
    {
        auto act = finally([]{ cout << "Exit test\n"; });  // establish exit action
        // ...
        if (something) return;   // act done here
        // ...
    } // act done here

The whole purpose of `final_action` is to get a piece of code (usually a lambda) executed upon destruction.

##### Note

There are two general categories of classes that need a user-defined destructor:

* A class with a resource that is not already represented as a class with a destructor, e.g., a `vector` or a transaction class.
* A class that exists primarily to execute an action upon destruction, such as a tracer or `final_action`.

##### Example, bad

    class Foo {   // bad; use the default destructor
    public:
        // ...
        ~Foo() { s = ""; i = 0; vi.clear(); }  // clean up
    private:
        string s;
        int i;
        vector<int> vi;
    };

The default destructor does it better, more efficiently, and can't get it wrong.

##### Note

If the default destructor is needed, but its generation has been suppressed (e.g., by defining a move constructor), use `=default`.

##### Enforcement

Look for likely "implicit resources", such as pointers and references. Look for classes with destructors even though all their data members have destructors.

### <a name="Rc-dtor-release"></a>C.31: All resources acquired by a class must be released by the class's destructor

##### Reason

Prevention of resource leaks, especially in error cases.

##### Note

For resources represented as classes with a complete set of default operations, this happens automatically.

##### Example

    class X {
        ifstream f;   // may own a file
        // ... no default operations defined or =deleted ...
    };

`X`'s `ifstream` implicitly closes any file it may have open upon destruction of its `X`.

##### Example, bad

    class X2 {     // bad
        FILE* f;   // may own a file
        // ... no default operations defined or =deleted ...
    };

`X2` may leak a file handle.

##### Note

What about a sockets that won't close? A destructor, close, or cleanup operation [should never fail](#Rc-dtor-fail).
If it does nevertheless, we have a problem that has no really good solution.
For starters, the writer of a destructor does not know why the destructor is called and cannot "refuse to act" by throwing an exception.
See [discussion](#Sd-never-fail).
To make the problem worse, many "close/release" operations are not retryable.
Many have tried to solve this problem, but no general solution is known.
If at all possible, consider failure to close/cleanup a fundamental design error and terminate.

##### Note

A class can hold pointers and references to objects that it does not own.
Obviously, such objects should not be `delete`d by the class's destructor.
For example:

    Preprocessor pp { /* ... */ };
    Parser p { pp, /* ... */ };
    Type_checker tc { p, /* ... */ };

Here `p` refers to `pp` but does not own it.

##### Enforcement

* (Simple) If a class has pointer or reference member variables that are owners
  (e.g., deemed owners by using `gsl::owner`), then they should be referenced in its destructor.
* (Hard) Determine if pointer or reference member variables are owners when there is no explicit statement of ownership
  (e.g., look into the constructors).

### <a name="Rc-dtor-ptr"></a>C.32: If a class has a raw pointer (`T*`) or reference (`T&`), consider whether it might be owning

##### Reason

There is a lot of code that is non-specific about ownership.

##### Example

    ???

##### Note

If the `T*` or `T&` is owning, mark it `owning`. If the `T*` is not owning, consider marking it `ptr`.
This will aid documentation and analysis.

##### Enforcement

Look at the initialization of raw member pointers and member references and see if an allocation is used.

### <a name="Rc-dtor-ptr2"></a>C.33: If a class has an owning pointer member, define a destructor

##### Reason

An owned object must be `deleted` upon destruction of the object that owns it.

##### Example

A pointer member may represent a resource.
[A `T*` should not do so](#Rr-ptr), but in older code, that's common.
Consider a `T*` a possible owner and therefore suspect.

    template<typename T>
    class Smart_ptr {
        T* p;   // BAD: vague about ownership of *p
        // ...
    public:
        // ... no user-defined default operations ...
    };

    void use(Smart_ptr<int> p1)
    {
        // error: p2.p leaked (if not nullptr and not owned by some other code)
        auto p2 = p1;
    }

Note that if you define a destructor, you must define or delete [all default operations](#Rc-five):

    template<typename T>
    class Smart_ptr2 {
        T* p;   // BAD: vague about ownership of *p
        // ...
    public:
        // ... no user-defined copy operations ...
        ~Smart_ptr2() { delete p; }  // p is an owner!
    };

    void use(Smart_ptr2<int> p1)
    {
        auto p2 = p1;   // error: double deletion
    }

The default copy operation will just copy the `p1.p` into `p2.p` leading to a double destruction of `p1.p`. Be explicit about ownership:

    template<typename T>
    class Smart_ptr3 {
        owner<T*> p;   // OK: explicit about ownership of *p
        // ...
    public:
        // ...
        // ... copy and move operations ...
        ~Smart_ptr3() { delete p; }
    };

    void use(Smart_ptr3<int> p1)
    {
        auto p2 = p1;   // error: double deletion
    }

##### Note

Often the simplest way to get a destructor is to replace the pointer with a smart pointer (e.g., `std::unique_ptr`) and let the compiler arrange for proper destruction to be done implicitly.

##### Note

Why not just require all owning pointers to be "smart pointers"?
That would sometimes require non-trivial code changes and may affect ABIs.

##### Enforcement

* A class with a pointer data member is suspect.
* A class with an `owner<T>` should define its default operations.

### <a name="Rc-dtor-ref"></a>C.34: If a class has an owning reference member, define a destructor

##### Reason

A reference member may represent a resource.
It should not do so, but in older code, that's common.
See [pointer members and destructors](#Rc-dtor-ptr).
Also, copying may lead to slicing.

##### Example, bad

    class Handle {  // Very suspect
        Shape& s;   // use reference rather than pointer to prevent rebinding
                    // BAD: vague about ownership of *p
        // ...
    public:
        Handle(Shape& ss) : s{ss} { /* ... */ }
        // ...
    };

The problem of whether `Handle` is responsible for the destruction of its `Shape` is the same as for [the pointer case](#Rc-dtor-ptr):
If the `Handle` owns the object referred to by `s` it must have a destructor.

##### Example

    class Handle {        // OK
        owner<Shape&> s;  // use reference rather than pointer to prevent rebinding
        // ...
    public:
        Handle(Shape& ss) : s{ss} { /* ... */ }
        ~Handle() { delete &s; }
        // ...
    };

Independently of whether `Handle` owns its `Shape`, we must consider the default copy operations suspect:

    // the Handle had better own the Circle or we have a leak
    Handle x {*new Circle{p1, 17}};

    Handle y {*new Triangle{p1, p2, p3}};
    x = y;     // the default assignment will try *x.s = *y.s

That `x = y` is highly suspect.
Assigning a `Triangle` to a `Circle`?
Unless `Shape` has its [copy assignment `=deleted`](#Rc-copy-virtual), only the `Shape` part of `Triangle` is copied into the `Circle`.

##### Note

Why not just require all owning references to be replaced by "smart pointers"?
Changing from references to smart pointers implies code changes.
We don't (yet) have smart references.
Also, that may affect ABIs.

##### Enforcement

* A class with a reference data member is suspect.
* A class with an `owner<T>` reference should define its default operations.

### <a name="Rc-dtor-virtual"></a>C.35: A base class destructor should be either public and virtual, or protected and nonvirtual

##### Reason

To prevent undefined behavior.
If the destructor is public, then calling code can attempt to destroy a derived class object through a base class pointer, and the result is undefined if the base class's destructor is non-virtual.
If the destructor is protected, then calling code cannot destroy through a base class pointer and the destructor does not need to be virtual; it does need to be protected, not private, so that derived destructors can invoke it.
In general, the writer of a base class does not know the appropriate action to be done upon destruction.

##### Discussion

See [this in the Discussion section](#Sd-dtor).

##### Example, bad

    struct Base {  // BAD: no virtual destructor
        virtual void f();
    };

    struct D : Base {
        string s {"a resource needing cleanup"};
        ~D() { /* ... do some cleanup ... */ }
        // ...
    };

    void use()
    {
        unique_ptr<Base> p = make_unique<D>();
        // ...
    } // p's destruction calls ~Base(), not ~D(), which leaks D::s and possibly more

##### Note

A virtual function defines an interface to derived classes that can be used without looking at the derived classes.
If the interface allows destroying, it should be safe to do so.

##### Note

A destructor must be nonprivate or it will prevent using the type :

    class X {
        ~X();   // private destructor
        // ...
    };

    void use()
    {
        X a;                        // error: cannot destroy
        auto p = make_unique<X>();  // error: cannot destroy
    }

##### Exception

We can imagine one case where you could want a protected virtual destructor: When an object of a derived type (and only of such a type) should be allowed to destroy *another* object (not itself) through a pointer to base. We haven't seen such a case in practice, though.

##### Enforcement

* A class with any virtual functions should have a destructor that is either public and virtual or else protected and nonvirtual.

### <a name="Rc-dtor-fail"></a>C.36: A destructor may not fail

##### Reason

In general we do not know how to write error-free code if a destructor should fail.
The standard library requires that all classes it deals with have destructors that do not exit by throwing.

##### Example

    class X {
    public:
        ~X() noexcept;
        // ...
    };

    X::~X() noexcept
    {
        // ...
        if (cannot_release_a_resource) terminate();
        // ...
    }

##### Note

Many have tried to devise a fool-proof scheme for dealing with failure in destructors.
None have succeeded to come up with a general scheme.
This can be a real practical problem: For example, what about a socket that won't close?
The writer of a destructor does not know why the destructor is called and cannot "refuse to act" by throwing an exception.
See [discussion](#Sd-dtor).
To make the problem worse, many "close/release" operations are not retryable.
If at all possible, consider failure to close/cleanup a fundamental design error and terminate.

##### Note

Declare a destructor `noexcept`. That will ensure that it either completes normally or terminate the program.

##### Note

If a resource cannot be released and the program may not fail, try to signal the failure to the rest of the system somehow
(maybe even by modifying some global state and hope something will notice and be able to take care of the problem).
Be fully aware that this technique is special-purpose and error-prone.
Consider the "my connection will not close" example.
Probably there is a problem at the other end of the connection and only a piece of code responsible for both ends of the connection can properly handle the problem.
The destructor could send a message (somehow) to the responsible part of the system, consider that to have closed the connection, and return normally.

##### Note

If a destructor uses operations that may fail, it can catch exceptions and in some cases still complete successfully
(e.g., by using a different clean-up mechanism from the one that threw an exception).

##### Enforcement

(Simple) A destructor should be declared `noexcept` if it could throw.

### <a name="Rc-dtor-noexcept"></a>C.37: Make destructors `noexcept`

##### Reason

 [A destructor may not fail](#Rc-dtor-fail). If a destructor tries to exit with an exception, it's a bad design error and the program had better terminate.

##### Note

A destructor (either user-defined or compiler-generated) is implicitly declared `noexcept` (independently of what code is in its body) if all of the members of its class have `noexcept` destructors. By explicitly marking destructors `noexcept`, an author guards against the destructor becoming implicitly `noexcept(false)` through the addition or modification of a class member.

##### Enforcement

(Simple) A destructor should be declared `noexcept` if it could throw.

## <a name="SS-ctor"></a>C.ctor: Constructors

A constructor defines how an object is initialized (constructed).

### <a name="Rc-ctor"></a>C.40: Define a constructor if a class has an invariant

##### Reason

That's what constructors are for.

##### Example

    class Date {  // a Date represents a valid date
                  // in the January 1, 1900 to December 31, 2100 range
        Date(int dd, int mm, int yy)
            :d{dd}, m{mm}, y{yy}
        {
            if (!is_valid(d, m, y)) throw Bad_date{};  // enforce invariant
        }
        // ...
    private:
        int d, m, y;
    };

It is often a good idea to express the invariant as an `Ensures` on the constructor.

##### Note

A constructor can be used for convenience even if a class does not have an invariant. For example:

    struct Rec {
        string s;
        int i {0};
        Rec(const string& ss) : s{ss} {}
        Rec(int ii) :i{ii} {}
    };

    Rec r1 {7};
    Rec r2 {"Foo bar"};

##### Note

The C++11 initializer list rule eliminates the need for many constructors. For example:

    struct Rec2{
        string s;
        int i;
        Rec2(const string& ss, int ii = 0) :s{ss}, i{ii} {}   // redundant
    };

    Rec2 r1 {"Foo", 7};
    Rec2 r2 {"Bar"};

The `Rec2` constructor is redundant.
Also, the default for `int` would be better done as a [member initializer](#Rc-in-class-initializer).

**See also**: [construct valid object](#Rc-complete) and [constructor throws](#Rc-throw).

##### Enforcement

* Flag classes with user-defined copy operations but no constructor (a user-defined copy is a good indicator that the class has an invariant)

### <a name="Rc-complete"></a>C.41: A constructor should create a fully initialized object

##### Reason

A constructor establishes the invariant for a class. A user of a class should be able to assume that a constructed object is usable.

##### Example, bad

    class X1 {
        FILE* f;   // call init() before any other function
        // ...
    public:
        X1() {}
        void init();   // initialize f
        void read();   // read from f
        // ...
    };

    void f()
    {
        X1 file;
        file.read();   // crash or bad read!
        // ...
        file.init();   // too late
        // ...
    }

Compilers do not read comments.

##### Exception

If a valid object cannot conveniently be constructed by a constructor, [use a factory function](#Rc-factory).

##### Enforcement

* (Simple) Every constructor should initialize every member variable (either explicitly, via a delegating ctor call or via default construction).
* (Unknown) If a constructor has an `Ensures` contract, try to see if it holds as a postcondition.

##### Note

If a constructor acquires a resource (to create a valid object), that resource should be [released by the destructor](#Rc-dtor-release).
The idiom of having constructors acquire resources and destructors release them is called [RAII](#Rr-raii) ("Resource Acquisition Is Initialization").

### <a name="Rc-throw"></a>C.42: If a constructor cannot construct a valid object, throw an exception

##### Reason

Leaving behind an invalid object is asking for trouble.

##### Example

    class X2 {
        FILE* f;   // call init() before any other function
        // ...
    public:
        X2(const string& name)
            :f{fopen(name.c_str(), "r")}
        {
            if (f == nullptr) throw runtime_error{"could not open" + name};
            // ...
        }

        void read();      // read from f
        // ...
    };

    void f()
    {
        X2 file {"Zeno"}; // throws if file isn't open
        file.read();      // fine
        // ...
    }

##### Example, bad

    class X3 {     // bad: the constructor leaves a non-valid object behind
        FILE* f;   // call init() before any other function
        bool valid;
        // ...
    public:
        X3(const string& name)
            :f{fopen(name.c_str(), "r")}, valid{false}
        {
            if (f) valid = true;
            // ...
        }

        bool is_valid() { return valid; }
        void read();   // read from f
        // ...
    };

    void f()
    {
        X3 file {"Heraclides"};
        file.read();   // crash or bad read!
        // ...
        if (file.is_valid()) {
            file.read();
            // ...
        }
        else {
            // ... handle error ...
        }
        // ...
    }

##### Note

For a variable definition (e.g., on the stack or as a member of another object) there is no explicit function call from which an error code could be returned.
Leaving behind an invalid object and relying on users to consistently check an `is_valid()` function before use is tedious, error-prone, and inefficient.

##### Exception

There are domains, such as some hard-real-time systems (think airplane controls) where (without additional tool support) exception handling is not sufficiently predictable from a timing perspective.
There the `is_valid()` technique must be used. In such cases, check `is_valid()` consistently and immediately to simulate [RAII](#Rr-raii).

**Alternative**: If you feel tempted to use some "post-constructor initialization" or "two-stage initialization" idiom, try not to do that.
If you really have to, look at [factory functions](#Rc-factory).

##### Note

One reason people have used `init()` functions rather than doing the initialization work in a constructor has been to avoid code replication.
[Delegating constructors](#Rc-delegating) and [default member initialization](#Rc-in-class-initializer) do that better.
Another reason is been to delay initialization until an object is needed; the solution to that is often [not to declare a variable until it can be properly initialized](#Res-init)

##### Enforcement

### <a name="Rc-default0"></a>C.43: Ensure that a class has a default constructor

##### Reason

Many language and library facilities rely on default constructors to initialize their elements, e.g. `T a[10]` and `std::vector<T> v(10)`.

##### Example , bad

    class Date { // BAD: no default constructor
    public:
        Date(int dd, int mm, int yyyy);
        // ...
    };

    vector<Date> vd1(1000);   // default Date needed here
    vector<Date> vd2(1000, Date{Month::october, 7, 1885});   // alternative

The default constructor is only auto-generated if there is no user-declared constructor, hence it's impossible to initialize the vector `vd1` in the example above.

There is no "natural" default date (the big bang is too far back in time to be useful for most people), so this example is non-trivial.
`{0, 0, 0}` is not a valid date in most calendar systems, so choosing that would be introducing something like floating-point's `NaN`.
However, most realistic `Date` classes have a "first date" (e.g. January 1, 1970 is popular), so making that the default is usually trivial.

##### Example

    class Date {
    public:
        Date(int dd, int mm, int yyyy);
        Date() = default; // See also C.45
        // ...
    private:
        int dd = 1;
        int mm = 1;
        int yyyy = 1970;
        // ...
    };

    vector<Date> vd1(1000);

##### Note

A class with members that all have default constructors implicitly gets a default constructor:

    struct X {
        string s;
        vector<int> v;
    };

    X x; // means X{{}, {}}; that is the empty string and the empty vector

Beware that built-in types are not properly default constructed:

    struct X {
        string s;
        int i;
    };

    void f()
    {
        X x;    // x.s is initialized to the empty string; x.i is uninitialized

        cout << x.s << ' ' << x.i << '\n';
        ++x.i;
    }

Statically allocated objects of built-in types are by default initialized to `0`, but local built-in variables are not.
Beware that your compiler may default initialize local built-in variables, whereas an optimized build will not.
Thus, code like the example above may appear to work, but it relies on undefined behavior.
Assuming that you want initialization, an explicit default initialization can help:

    struct X {
        string s;
        int i {};   // default initialize (to 0)
    };

##### Enforcement

* Flag classes without a default constructor

### <a name="Rc-default00"></a>C.44: Prefer default constructors to be simple and non-throwing

##### Reason

Being able to set a value to "the default" without operations that might fail simplifies error handling and reasoning about move operations.

##### Example, problematic

    template<typename T>
    // elem points to space-elem element allocated using new
    class Vector0 {
    public:
        Vector0() :Vector0{0} {}
        Vector0(int n) :elem{new T[n]}, space{elem + n}, last{elem} {}
        // ...
    private:
        own<T*> elem;
        T* space;
        T* last;
    };

This is nice and general, but setting a `Vector0` to empty after an error involves an allocation, which may fail.
Also, having a default `Vector` represented as `{new T[0], 0, 0}` seems wasteful.
For example, `Vector0 v(100)` costs 100 allocations.

##### Example

    template<typename T>
    // elem is nullptr or elem points to space-elem element allocated using new
    class Vector1 {
    public:
        // sets the representation to {nullptr, nullptr, nullptr}; doesn't throw
        Vector1() noexcept {}
        Vector1(int n) :elem{new T[n]}, space{elem + n}, last{elem} {}
        // ...
    private:
        own<T*> elem = nullptr;
        T* space = nullptr;
        T* last = nullptr;
    };

Using `{nullptr, nullptr, nullptr}` makes `Vector1{}` cheap, but a special case and implies run-time checks.
Setting a `Vector1` to empty after detecting an error is trivial.

##### Enforcement

* Flag throwing default constructors

### <a name="Rc-default"></a>C.45: Don't define a default constructor that only initializes data members; use in-class member initializers instead

##### Reason

Using in-class member initializers lets the compiler generate the function for you. The compiler-generated function can be more efficient.

##### Example, bad

    class X1 { // BAD: doesn't use member initializers
        string s;
        int i;
    public:
        X1() :s{"default"}, i{1} { }
        // ...
    };

##### Example

    class X2 {
        string s = "default";
        int i = 1;
    public:
        // use compiler-generated default constructor
        // ...
    };

##### Enforcement

(Simple) A default constructor should do more than just initialize member variables with constants.

### <a name="Rc-explicit"></a>C.46: By default, declare single-argument constructors explicit

##### Reason

To avoid unintended conversions.

##### Example, bad

    class String {
        // ...
    public:
        String(int);   // BAD
        // ...
    };

    String s = 10;   // surprise: string of size 10

##### Exception

If you really want an implicit conversion from the constructor argument type to the class type, don't use `explicit`:

    class Complex {
        // ...
    public:
        Complex(double d);   // OK: we want a conversion from d to {d, 0}
        // ...
    };

    Complex z = 10.7;   // unsurprising conversion

**See also**: [Discussion of implicit conversions](#Ro-conversion).

##### Enforcement

(Simple) Single-argument constructors should be declared `explicit`. Good single argument non-`explicit` constructors are rare in most code based. Warn for all that are not on a "positive list".

### <a name="Rc-order"></a>C.47: Define and initialize member variables in the order of member declaration

##### Reason

To minimize confusion and errors. That is the order in which the initialization happens (independent of the order of member initializers).

##### Example, bad

    class Foo {
        int m1;
        int m2;
    public:
        Foo(int x) :m2{x}, m1{++x} { }   // BAD: misleading initializer order
        // ...
    };

    Foo x(1); // surprise: x.m1 == x.m2 == 2

##### Enforcement

(Simple) A member initializer list should mention the members in the same order they are declared.

**See also**: [Discussion](#Sd-order)

### <a name="Rc-in-class-initializer"></a>C.48: Prefer in-class initializers to member initializers in constructors for constant initializers

##### Reason

Makes it explicit that the same value is expected to be used in all constructors. Avoids repetition. Avoids maintenance problems. It leads to the shortest and most efficient code.

##### Example, bad

    class X {   // BAD
        int i;
        string s;
        int j;
    public:
        X() :i{666}, s{"qqq"} { }   // j is uninitialized
        X(int ii) :i{ii} {}         // s is "" and j is uninitialized
        // ...
    };

How would a maintainer know whether `j` was deliberately uninitialized (probably a poor idea anyway) and whether it was intentional to give `s` the default value `""` in one case and `qqq` in another (almost certainly a bug)? The problem with `j` (forgetting to initialize a member) often happens when a new member is added to an existing class.

##### Example

    class X2 {
        int i {666};
        string s {"qqq"};
        int j {0};
    public:
        X2() = default;        // all members are initialized to their defaults
        X2(int ii) :i{ii} {}   // s and j initialized to their defaults
        // ...
    };

**Alternative**: We can get part of the benefits from default arguments to constructors, and that is not uncommon in older code. However, that is less explicit, causes more arguments to be passed, and is repetitive when there is more than one constructor:

    class X3 {   // BAD: inexplicit, argument passing overhead
        int i;
        string s;
        int j;
    public:
        X3(int ii = 666, const string& ss = "qqq", int jj = 0)
            :i{ii}, s{ss}, j{jj} { }   // all members are initialized to their defaults
        // ...
    };

##### Enforcement

* (Simple) Every constructor should initialize every member variable (either explicitly, via a delegating ctor call or via default construction).
* (Simple) Default arguments to constructors suggest an in-class initializer may be more appropriate.

### <a name="Rc-initialize"></a>C.49: Prefer initialization to assignment in constructors

##### Reason

An initialization explicitly states that initialization, rather than assignment, is done and can be more elegant and efficient. Prevents "use before set" errors.

##### Example, good

    class A {   // Good
        string s1;
    public:
        A() : s1{"Hello, "} { }    // GOOD: directly construct
        // ...
    };

##### Example, bad

    class B {   // BAD
        string s1;
    public:
        B() { s1 = "Hello, "; }   // BAD: default constructor followed by assignment
        // ...
    };

    class C {   // UGLY, aka very bad
        int* p;
    public:
        C() { cout << *p; p = new int{10}; }   // accidental use before initialized
        // ...
    };

### <a name="Rc-factory"></a>C.50: Use a factory function if you need "virtual behavior" during initialization

##### Reason

If the state of a base class object must depend on the state of a derived part of the object, we need to use a virtual function (or equivalent) while minimizing the window of opportunity to misuse an imperfectly constructed object.

##### Note

The return type of the factory should normally be `unique_ptr` by default; if some uses are shared, the caller can `move` the `unique_ptr` into a `shared_ptr`. However, if the factory author knows that all uses of the returned object will be shared uses, return `shared_ptr` and use `make_shared` in the body to save an allocation.

##### Example, bad

    class B {
    public:
        B()
        {
            // ...
            f();   // BAD: virtual call in constructor
            // ...
        }

        virtual void f() = 0;

        // ...
    };

##### Example

    class B {
    protected:
        B() { /* ... */ }              // create an imperfectly initialized object

        virtual void PostInitialize()  // to be called right after construction
        {
            // ...
            f();    // GOOD: virtual dispatch is safe
            // ...
        }

    public:
        virtual void f() = 0;

        template<class T>
        static shared_ptr<T> Create()  // interface for creating shared objects
        {
            auto p = make_shared<T>();
            p->PostInitialize();
            return p;
        }
    };

    class D : public B { /* ... */ };  // some derived class

    shared_ptr<D> p = D::Create<D>();  // creating a D object

By making the constructor `protected` we avoid an incompletely constructed object escaping into the wild.
By providing the factory function `Create()`, we make construction (on the free store) convenient.

##### Note

Conventional factory functions allocate on the free store, rather than on the stack or in an enclosing object.

### <a name="Rc-delegating"></a>C.51: Use delegating constructors to represent common actions for all constructors of a class

##### Reason

To avoid repetition and accidental differences.

##### Example, bad

    class Date {   // BAD: repetitive
        int d;
        Month m;
        int y;
    public:
        Date(int ii, Month mm, year yy)
            :i{ii}, m{mm}, y{yy}
            { if (!valid(i, m, y)) throw Bad_date{}; }

        Date(int ii, Month mm)
            :i{ii}, m{mm} y{current_year()}
            { if (!valid(i, m, y)) throw Bad_date{}; }
        // ...
    };

The common action gets tedious to write and may accidentally not be common.

##### Example

    class Date2 {
        int d;
        Month m;
        int y;
    public:
        Date2(int ii, Month mm, year yy)
            :i{ii}, m{mm}, y{yy}
            { if (!valid(i, m, y)) throw Bad_date{}; }

        Date2(int ii, Month mm)
            :Date2{ii, mm, current_year()} {}
        // ...
    };

**See also**: If the "repeated action" is a simple initialization, consider [an in-class member initializer](#Rc-in-class-initializer).

##### Enforcement

(Moderate) Look for similar constructor bodies.

### <a name="Rc-inheriting"></a>C.52: Use inheriting constructors to import constructors into a derived class that does not need further explicit initialization

##### Reason

If you need those constructors for a derived class, re-implementing them is tedious and error prone.

##### Example

`std::vector` has a lot of tricky constructors, so if I want my own `vector`, I don't want to reimplement them:

    class Rec {
        // ... data and lots of nice constructors ...
    };

    class Oper : public Rec {
        using Rec::Rec;
        // ... no data members ...
        // ... lots of nice utility functions ...
    };

##### Example, bad

    struct Rec2 : public Rec {
        int x;
        using Rec::Rec;
    };

    Rec2 r {"foo", 7};
    int val = r.x;   // uninitialized

##### Enforcement

Make sure that every member of the derived class is initialized.

## <a name="SS-copy"></a>C.copy: Copy and move

Value types should generally be copyable, but interfaces in a class hierarchy should not.
Resource handles may or may not be copyable.
Types can be defined to move for logical as well as performance reasons.

### <a name="Rc-copy-assignment"></a>C.60: Make copy assignment non-`virtual`, take the parameter by `const&`, and return by non-`const&`

##### Reason

It is simple and efficient. If you want to optimize for rvalues, provide an overload that takes a `&&` (see [F.24](#Rf-pass-ref-ref)).

##### Example

    class Foo {
    public:
        Foo& operator=(const Foo& x)
        {
            // GOOD: no need to check for self-assignment (other than performance)
            auto tmp = x;
            std::swap(*this, tmp);
            return *this;
        }
        // ...
    };

    Foo a;
    Foo b;
    Foo f();

    a = b;    // assign lvalue: copy
    a = f();  // assign rvalue: potentially move

##### Note

The `swap` implementation technique offers the [strong guarantee](???).

##### Example

But what if you can get significantly better performance by not making a temporary copy? Consider a simple `Vector` intended for a domain where assignment of large, equal-sized `Vector`s is common. In this case, the copy of elements implied by the `swap` implementation technique could cause an order of magnitude increase in cost:

    template<typename T>
    class Vector {
    public:
        Vector& operator=(const Vector&);
        // ...
    private:
        T* elem;
        int sz;
    };

    Vector& Vector::operator=(const Vector& a)
    {
        if (a.sz > sz) {
            // ... use the swap technique, it can't be bettered ...
            return *this
        }
        // ... copy sz elements from *a.elem to elem ...
        if (a.sz < sz) {
            // ... destroy the surplus elements in *this* and adjust size ...
        }
        return *this;
    }

By writing directly to the target elements, we will get only [the basic guarantee](#???) rather than the strong guarantee offered by the `swap` technique. Beware of [self assignment](#Rc-copy-self).

**Alternatives**: If you think you need a `virtual` assignment operator, and understand why that's deeply problematic, don't call it `operator=`. Make it a named function like `virtual void assign(const Foo&)`.
See [copy constructor vs. `clone()`](#Rc-copy-virtual).

##### Enforcement

* (Simple) An assignment operator should not be virtual. Here be dragons!
* (Simple) An assignment operator should return `T&` to enable chaining, not alternatives like `const T&` which interfere with composability and putting objects in containers.
* (Moderate) An assignment operator should (implicitly or explicitly) invoke all base and member assignment operators.
  Look at the destructor to determine if the type has pointer semantics or value semantics.

### <a name="Rc-copy-semantic"></a>C.61: A copy operation should copy

##### Reason

That is the generally assumed semantics. After `x = y`, we should have `x == y`.
After a copy `x` and `y` can be independent objects (value semantics, the way non-pointer built-in types and the standard-library types work) or refer to a shared object (pointer semantics, the way pointers work).

##### Example

    class X {   // OK: value semantics
    public:
        X();
        X(const X&);     // copy X
        void modify();   // change the value of X
        // ...
        ~X() { delete[] p; }
    private:
        T* p;
        int sz;
    };

    bool operator==(const X& a, const X& b)
    {
        return a.sz == b.sz && equal(a.p, a.p + a.sz, b.p, b.p + b.sz);
    }

    X::X(const X& a)
        :p{new T[a.sz]}, sz{a.sz}
    {
        copy(a.p, a.p + sz, a.p);
    }

    X x;
    X y = x;
    if (x != y) throw Bad{};
    x.modify();
    if (x == y) throw Bad{};   // assume value semantics

##### Example

    class X2 {  // OK: pointer semantics
    public:
        X2();
        X2(const X&) = default; // shallow copy
        ~X2() = default;
        void modify();          // change the value of X
        // ...
    private:
        T* p;
        int sz;
    };

    bool operator==(const X2& a, const X2& b)
    {
        return a.sz == b.sz && a.p == b.p;
    }

    X2 x;
    X2 y = x;
    if (x != y) throw Bad{};
    x.modify();
    if (x != y) throw Bad{};  // assume pointer semantics

##### Note

Prefer copy semantics unless you are building a "smart pointer". Value semantics is the simplest to reason about and what the standard library facilities expect.

##### Enforcement

(Not enforceable)

### <a name="Rc-copy-self"></a>C.62: Make copy assignment safe for self-assignment

##### Reason

If `x = x` changes the value of `x`, people will be surprised and bad errors will occur (often including leaks).

##### Example

The standard-library containers handle self-assignment elegantly and efficiently:

    std::vector<int> v = {3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9};
    v = v;
    // the value of v is still {3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9}

##### Note

The default assignment generated from members that handle self-assignment correctly handles self-assignment.

    struct Bar {
        vector<pair<int, int>> v;
        map<string, int> m;
        string s;
    };

    Bar b;
    // ...
    b = b;   // correct and efficient

##### Note

You can handle self-assignment by explicitly testing for self-assignment, but often it is faster and more elegant to cope without such a test (e.g., [using `swap`](#Rc-swap)).

    class Foo {
        string s;
        int i;
    public:
        Foo& operator=(const Foo& a);
        // ...
    };

    Foo& Foo::operator=(const Foo& a)   // OK, but there is a cost
    {
        if (this == &a) return *this;
        s = a.s;
        i = a.i;
        return *this;
    }

This is obviously safe and apparently efficient.
However, what if we do one self-assignment per million assignments?
That's about a million redundant tests (but since the answer is essentially always the same, the computer's branch predictor will guess right essentially every time).
Consider:

    Foo& Foo::operator=(const Foo& a)   // simpler, and probably much better
    {
        s = a.s;
        i = a.i;
        return *this;
    }

`std::string` is safe for self-assignment and so are `int`. All the cost is carried by the (rare) case of self-assignment.

##### Enforcement

(Simple) Assignment operators should not contain the pattern `if (this == &a) return *this;` ???

### <a name="Rc-move-assignment"></a>C.63: Make move assignment non-`virtual`, take the parameter by `&&`, and return by non-`const &`

##### Reason

It is simple and efficient.

**See**: [The rule for copy-assignment](#Rc-copy-assignment).

##### Enforcement

Equivalent to what is done for [copy-assignment](#Rc-copy-assignment).

* (Simple) An assignment operator should not be virtual. Here be dragons!
* (Simple) An assignment operator should return `T&` to enable chaining, not alternatives like `const T&` which interfere with composability and putting objects in containers.
* (Moderate) A move assignment operator should (implicitly or explicitly) invoke all base and member move assignment operators.

### <a name="Rc-move-semantic"></a>C.64: A move operation should move and leave its source in a valid state

##### Reason

That is the generally assumed semantics.
After `y = std::move(x)` the value of `y` should be the value `x` had and `x` should be in a valid state.

##### Example

    template<typename T>
    class X {   // OK: value semantics
    public:
        X();
        X(X&& a);          // move X
        void modify();     // change the value of X
        // ...
        ~X() { delete[] p; }
    private:
        T* p;
        int sz;
    };


    X::X(X&& a)
        :p{a.p}, sz{a.sz}  // steal representation
    {
        a.p = nullptr;     // set to "empty"
        a.sz = 0;
    }

    void use()
    {
        X x{};
        // ...
        X y = std::move(x);
        x = X{};   // OK
    } // OK: x can be destroyed

##### Note

Ideally, that moved-from should be the default value of the type.
Ensure that unless there is an exceptionally good reason not to.
However, not all types have a default value and for some types establishing the default value can be expensive.
The standard requires only that the moved-from object can be destroyed.
Often, we can easily and cheaply do better: The standard library assumes that it it possible to assign to a moved-from object.
Always leave the moved-from object in some (necessarily specified) valid state.

##### Note

Unless there is an exceptionally strong reason not to, make `x = std::move(y); y = z;` work with the conventional semantics.

##### Enforcement

(Not enforceable) Look for assignments to members in the move operation. If there is a default constructor, compare those assignments to the initializations in the default constructor.

### <a name="Rc-move-self"></a>C.65: Make move assignment safe for self-assignment

##### Reason

If `x = x` changes the value of `x`, people will be surprised and bad errors may occur. However, people don't usually directly write a self-assignment that turn into a move, but it can occur. However, `std::swap` is implemented using move operations so if you accidentally do `swap(a, b)` where `a` and `b` refer to the same object, failing to handle self-move could be a serious and subtle error.

##### Example

    class Foo {
        string s;
        int i;
    public:
        Foo& operator=(Foo&& a);
        // ...
    };

    Foo& Foo::operator=(Foo&& a)       // OK, but there is a cost
    {
        if (this == &a) return *this;  // this line is redundant
        s = std::move(a.s);
        i = a.i;
        return *this;
    }

The one-in-a-million argument against `if (this == &a) return *this;` tests from the discussion of [self-assignment](#Rc-copy-self) is even more relevant for self-move.

##### Note

There is no know general way of avoiding a `if (this == &a) return *this;` test for a move assignment and still get a correct answer (i.e., after `x = x` the value of `x` is unchanged).

##### Note

The ISO standard guarantees only a "valid but unspecified" state for the standard library containers. Apparently this has not been a problem in about 10 years of experimental and production use. Please contact the editors if you find a counter example. The rule here is more caution and insists on complete safety.

##### Example

Here is a way to move a pointer without a test (imagine it as code in the implementation a move assignment):

    // move from other.ptr to this->ptr
    T* temp = other.ptr;
    other.ptr = nullptr;
    delete ptr;
    ptr = temp;

##### Enforcement

* (Moderate) In the case of self-assignment, a move assignment operator should not leave the object holding pointer members that have been `delete`d or set to `nullptr`.
* (Not enforceable) Look at the use of standard-library container types (incl. `string`) and consider them safe for ordinary (not life-critical) uses.

### <a name="Rc-move-noexcept"></a>C.66: Make move operations `noexcept`

##### Reason

A throwing move violates most people's reasonably assumptions.
A non-throwing move will be used more efficiently by standard-library and language facilities.

##### Example

    template<typename T>
    class Vector {
        // ...
        Vector(Vector&& a) noexcept :elem{a.elem}, sz{a.sz} { a.sz = 0; a.elem = nullptr; }
        Vector& operator=(Vector&& a) noexcept { elem = a.elem; sz = a.sz; a.sz = 0; a.elem = nullptr; }
        // ...
    public:
        T* elem;
        int sz;
    };

These copy operations do not throw.

##### Example, bad

    template<typename T>
    class Vector2 {
        // ...
        Vector2(Vector2&& a) { *this = a; }             // just use the copy
        Vector2& operator=(Vector2&& a) { *this = a; }  // just use the copy
        // ...
    public:
        T* elem;
        int sz;
    };

This `Vector2` is not just inefficient, but since a vector copy requires allocation, it can throw.

##### Enforcement

(Simple) A move operation should be marked `noexcept`.

### <a name="Rc-copy-virtual"></a>C.67: A base class should suppress copying, and provide a virtual `clone` instead if "copying" is desired

##### Reason

To prevent slicing, because the normal copy operations will copy only the base portion of a derived object.

##### Example, bad

    class B { // BAD: base class doesn't suppress copying
        int data;
        // ... nothing about copy operations, so uses default ...
    };

    class D : public B {
        string more_data; // add a data member
        // ...
    };

    auto d = make_unique<D>();

    // oops, slices the object; gets only d.data but drops d.more_data
    auto b = make_unique<B>(d);

##### Example

    class B { // GOOD: base class suppresses copying
        B(const B&) = delete;
        B& operator=(const B&) = delete;
        virtual unique_ptr<B> clone() { return /* B object */; }
        // ...
    };

    class D : public B {
        string more_data; // add a data member
        unique_ptr<B> clone() override { return /* D object */; }
        // ...
    };

    auto d = make_unique<D>();
    auto b = d.clone(); // ok, deep clone

##### Note

It's good to return a smart pointer, but unlike with raw pointers the return type cannot be covariant (for example, `D::clone` can't return a `unique_ptr<D>`. Don't let this tempt you into returning an owning raw pointer; this is a minor drawback compared to the major robustness benefit delivered by the owning smart pointer.

##### Exception

If you need covariant return types, return an `owner<derived*>`. See [C.130](#Rh-copy).

##### Enforcement

A class with any virtual function should not have a copy constructor or copy assignment operator (compiler-generated or handwritten).

## C.other: Other default operation rules

In addition to the operations for which the language offer default implementations,
there are a few operations that are so foundational that it rules for their definition are needed:
comparisons, `swap`, and `hash`.

### <a name="Rc-eqdefault"></a>C.80: Use `=default` if you have to be explicit about using the default semantics

##### Reason

The compiler is more likely to get the default semantics right and you cannot implement these functions better than the compiler.

##### Example

    class Tracer {
        string message;
    public:
        Tracer(const string& m) : message{m} { cerr << "entering " << message << '\n'; }
        ~Tracer() { cerr << "exiting " << message << '\n'; }

        Tracer(const Tracer&) = default;
        Tracer& operator=(const Tracer&) = default;
        Tracer(Tracer&&) = default;
        Tracer& operator=(Tracer&&) = default;
    };

Because we defined the destructor, we must define the copy and move operations. The `= default` is the best and simplest way of doing that.

##### Example, bad

    class Tracer2 {
        string message;
    public:
        Tracer2(const string& m) : message{m} { cerr << "entering " << message << '\n'; }
        ~Tracer2() { cerr << "exiting " << message << '\n'; }

        Tracer2(const Tracer2& a) : message{a.message} {}
        Tracer2& operator=(const Tracer2& a) { message = a.message; return *this; }
        Tracer2(Tracer2&& a) :message{a.message} {}
        Tracer2& operator=(Tracer2&& a) { message = a.message; return *this; }
    };

Writing out the bodies of the copy and move operations is verbose, tedious, and error-prone. A compiler does it better.

##### Enforcement

(Moderate) The body of a special operation should not have the same accessibility and semantics as the compiler-generated version, because that would be redundant

### <a name="Rc-delete"></a>C.81: Use `=delete` when you want to disable default behavior (without wanting an alternative)

##### Reason

In a few cases, a default operation is not desirable.

##### Example

    class Immortal {
    public:
        ~Immortal() = delete;   // do not allow destruction
        // ...
    };

    void use()
    {
        Immortal ugh;   // error: ugh cannot be destroyed
        Immortal* p = new Immortal{};
        delete p;       // error: cannot destroy *p
    }

##### Example

A `unique_ptr` can be moved, but not copied. To achieve that its copy operations are deleted. To avoid copying it is necessary to `=delete` its copy operations from lvalues:

    template <class T, class D = default_delete<T>> class unique_ptr {
    public:
        // ...
        constexpr unique_ptr() noexcept;
        explicit unique_ptr(pointer p) noexcept;
        // ...
        unique_ptr(unique_ptr&& u) noexcept;   // move constructor
        // ...
        unique_ptr(const unique_ptr&) = delete; // disable copy from lvalue
        // ...
    };

    unique_ptr<int> make();   // make "something" and return it by moving

    void f()
    {
        unique_ptr<int> pi {};
        auto pi2 {pi};      // error: no move constructor from lvalue
        auto pi3 {make()};  // OK, move: the result of make() is an rvalue
    }

##### Enforcement

The elimination of a default operation is (should be) based on the desired semantics of the class. Consider such classes suspect, but maintain a "positive list" of classes where a human has asserted that the semantics is correct.

### <a name="Rc-ctor-virtual"></a>C.82: Don't call virtual functions in constructors and destructors

##### Reason

The function called will be that of the object constructed so far, rather than a possibly overriding function in a derived class.
This can be most confusing.
Worse, a direct or indirect call to an unimplemented pure virtual function from a constructor or destructor results in undefined behavior.

##### Example, bad

    class Base {
    public:
        virtual void f() = 0;   // not implemented
        virtual void g();       // implemented with Base version
        virtual void h();       // implemented with Base version
    };

    class Derived : public Base {
    public:
        void g() override;   // provide Derived implementation
        void h() final;      // provide Derived implementation

        Derived()
        {
            // BAD: attempt to call an unimplemented virtual function
            f();

            // BAD: will call Derived::g, not dispatch further virtually
            g();

            // GOOD: explicitly state intent to call only the visible version
            Derived::g();

            // ok, no qualification needed, h is final
            h();
        }
    };

Note that calling a specific explicitly qualified function is not a virtual call even if the function is `virtual`.

**See also** [factory functions](#Rc-factory) for how to achieve the effect of a call to a derived class function without risking undefined behavior.

##### Note

There is nothing inherently wrong with calling virtual functions from constructors and destructors.
The semantics of such calls is type safe.
However, experience shows that such calls are rarely needed, easily confuse maintainers, and become a source of errors when used by novices.

##### Enforcement

* Flag calls of virtual functions from constructors and destructors.

### <a name="Rc-swap"></a>C.83: For value-like types, consider providing a `noexcept` swap function

##### Reason

A `swap` can be handy for implementing a number of idioms, from smoothly moving objects around to implementing assignment easily to providing a guaranteed commit function that enables strongly error-safe calling code. Consider using swap to implement copy assignment in terms of copy construction. See also [destructors, deallocation, and swap must never fail](#Re-never-fail).

##### Example, good

    class Foo {
        // ...
    public:
        void swap(Foo& rhs) noexcept
        {
            m1.swap(rhs.m1);
            std::swap(m2, rhs.m2);
        }
    private:
        Bar m1;
        int m2;
    };

Providing a nonmember `swap` function in the same namespace as your type for callers' convenience.

    void swap(Foo& a, Foo& b)
    {
        a.swap(b);
    }

##### Enforcement

* (Simple) A class without virtual functions should have a `swap` member function declared.
* (Simple) When a class has a `swap` member function, it should be declared `noexcept`.

### <a name="Rc-swap-fail"></a>C.84: A `swap` function may not fail

##### Reason

 `swap` is widely used in ways that are assumed never to fail and programs cannot easily be written to work correctly in the presence of a failing `swap`. The standard-library containers and algorithms will not work correctly if a swap of an element type fails.

##### Example, bad

    void swap(My_vector& x, My_vector& y)
    {
        auto tmp = x;   // copy elements
        x = y;
        y = tmp;
    }

This is not just slow, but if a memory allocation occurs for the elements in `tmp`, this `swap` may throw and would make STL algorithms fail if used with them.

##### Enforcement

(Simple) When a class has a `swap` member function, it should be declared `noexcept`.

### <a name="Rc-swap-noexcept"></a>C.85: Make `swap` `noexcept`

##### Reason

 [A `swap` may not fail](#Rc-swap-fail).
If a `swap` tries to exit with an exception, it's a bad design error and the program had better terminate.

##### Enforcement

(Simple) When a class has a `swap` member function, it should be declared `noexcept`.

### <a name="Rc-eq"></a>C.86: Make `==` symmetric with respect to operand types and `noexcept`

##### Reason

Asymmetric treatment of operands is surprising and a source of errors where conversions are possible.
`==` is a fundamental operations and programmers should be able to use it without fear of failure.

##### Example

    class X {
        string name;
        int number;
    };

    bool operator==(const X& a, const X& b) noexcept {
        return a.name == b.name && a.number == b.number;
    }

##### Example, bad

    class B {
        string name;
        int number;
        bool operator==(const B& a) const {
            return name == a.name && number == a.number;
        }
        // ...
    };

`B`'s comparison accepts conversions for its second operand, but not its first.

##### Note

If a class has a failure state, like `double`'s `NaN`, there is a temptation to make a comparison against the failure state throw.
The alternative is to make two failure states compare equal and any valid state compare false against the failure state.

#### Note

This rule applies to all the usual comparison operators: `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=`.

##### Enforcement

* Flag an `operator==()` for which the argument types differ; same for other comparison operators: `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=`.
* Flag member `operator==()`s; same for other comparison operators: `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=`.

### <a name="Rc-eq-base"></a>C.87: Beware of `==` on base classes

##### Reason

It is really hard to write a foolproof and useful `==` for a hierarchy.

##### Example, bad

    class B {
        string name;
        int number;
        virtual bool operator==(const B& a) const
        {
             return name == a.name && number == a.number;
        }
        // ...
    };

`B`'s comparison accepts conversions for its second operand, but not its first.

    class D :B {
        char character;
        virtual bool operator==(const D& a) const
        {
            return name == a.name && number == a.number && character == a.character;
        }
        // ...
    };

    B b = ...
    D d = ...
    b == d;    // compares name and number, ignores d's character
    d == b;    // error: no == defined
    D d2;
    d == d2;   // compares name, number, and character
    B& b2 = d2;
    b2 == d;   // compares name and number, ignores d2's and d's character

Of course there are ways of making `==` work in a hierarchy, but the naive approaches do not scale

#### Note

This rule applies to all the usual comparison operators: `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=`.

##### Enforcement

* Flag a virtual `operator==()`; same for other comparison operators: `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=`.

### <a name="Rc-hash"></a>C.89: Make a `hash` `noexcept`

##### Reason

Users of hashed containers use hash indirectly and don't expect simple access to throw.
It's a standard-library requirement.

##### Example, bad

    template<>
    struct hash<My_type> {  // thoroughly bad hash specialization
        using result_type = size_t;
        using argument_type = My_type;

        size_t operator() (const My_type & x) const
        {
            size_t xs = x.s.size();
            if (xs < 4) throw Bad_My_type{};    // "Nobody expects the Spanish inquisition!"
            return hash<size_t>()(x.s.size()) ^ trim(x.s);
        }
    };

    int main()
    {
        unordered_map<My_type, int> m;
        My_type mt{ "asdfg" };
        m[mt] = 7;
        cout << m[My_type{ "asdfg" }] << '\n';
    }

If you have to define a `hash` specialization, try simply to let it combine standard-library `hash` specializations with `^` (xor).
That tends to work better than "cleverness" for non-specialists.

##### Enforcement

* Flag throwing `hash`es.

Function objects should be cheap to copy (and therefore [passed by value](#Rf-in)).

## <a name="SS-hier"></a>C.hier: Class hierarchies (OOP)

A class hierarchy is constructed to represent a set of hierarchically organized concepts (only).
Typically base classes act as interfaces.

### <a name="Rh-domain"></a>C.120: Use class hierarchies to represent concepts with inherent hierarchical structure (only)

##### Reason

Direct representation of ideas in code eases comprehension and maintenance. Make sure the idea represented in the base class exactly matches all derived types and there is not a better way to express it than using the tight coupling of inheritance.

Do *not* use inheritance when simply having a data member will do. Usually this means that the derived type needs to override a base virtual function or needs access to a protected member.

##### Example

    ??? Good old Shape example?

##### Example, bad

Do *not* represent non-hierarchical domain concepts as class hierarchies.

    template<typename T>
    class Container {
    public:
        // list operations:
        virtual T& get() = 0;
        virtual void put(T&) = 0;
        virtual void insert(Position) = 0;
        // ...
        // vector operations:
        virtual T& operator[](int) = 0;
        virtual void sort() = 0;
        // ...
        // tree operations:
        virtual void balance() = 0;
        // ...
    };

Here most overriding classes cannot implement most of the functions required in the interface well.
Thus the base class becomes an implementation burden.
Furthermore, the user of `Container` cannot rely on the member functions actually performing a meaningful operations reasonably efficiently;
it may throw an exception instead.
Thus users have to resort to run-time checking and/or
not using this (over)general interface in favor of a particular interface found by a run-time type inquiry (e.g., a `dynamic_cast`).

##### Enforcement

* Look for classes with lots of members that do nothing but throw.
* Flag every use of a nonpublic base class `B` where the derived class `D` does not override a virtual function or access a protected member in `B`, and `B` is not one of the following: empty, a template parameter or parameter pack of `D`, a class template specialized with `D`.

### <a name="Rh-abstract"></a>C.121: If a base class is used as an interface, make it a pure abstract class

##### Reason

A class is more stable (less brittle) if it does not contain data.
Interfaces should normally be composed entirely of public pure virtual functions and a default/empty virtual destructor.

##### Example

    class My_interface {
    public:
        // ...only pure virtual functions here ...
        virtual ~My_interface() {}   // or =default
    };

##### Example, bad

    class Goof {
    public:
        // ...only pure virtual functions here ...
        // no virtual destructor
    };

    class Derived : public Goof {
        string s;
        // ...
    };

    void use()
    {
        unique_ptr<Goof> p {new Derived{"here we go"}};
        f(p.get()); // use Derived through the Goof interface
        g(p.get()); // use Derived through the Goof interface
    } // leak

The `Derived` is `delete`d through its `Goof` interface, so its `string` is leaked.
Give `Goof` a virtual destructor and all is well.


##### Enforcement

* Warn on any class that contains data members and also has an overridable (non-`final`) virtual function.

### <a name="Rh-separation"></a>C.122: Use abstract classes as interfaces when complete separation of interface and implementation is needed

##### Reason

Such as on an ABI (link) boundary.

##### Example

    struct Device {
        virtual void write(span<const char> outbuf) = 0;
        virtual void read(span<char> inbuf) = 0;
    };

    class D1 : public Device {
        // ... data ...

        void write(span<const char> outbuf) override;
        void read(span<char> inbuf) override;
    };

    class D2 : public Device {
        // ... different data ...

        void write(span<const char> outbuf) override;
        void read(span<char> inbuf) override;
    };

A user can now use `D1`s and `D2`s interchangeably through the interface provided by `Device`.
Furthermore, we can update `D1` and `D2` in a ways that are not binary compatible with older versions as long as all access goes through `Device`.

## C.hierclass: Designing classes in a hierarchy:

### <a name="Rh-abstract-ctor"></a>C.126: An abstract class typically doesn't need a constructor

##### Reason

An abstract class typically does not have any data for a constructor to initialize.

##### Example

    ???

##### Exception

* A base class constructor that does work, such as registering an object somewhere, may need a constructor.
* In extremely rare cases, you might find it reasonable for an abstract class to have a bit of data shared by all derived classes
  (e.g., use statistics data, debug information, etc.); such classes tend to have constructors. But be warned: Such classes also tend to be prone to requiring virtual inheritance.

##### Enforcement

Flag abstract classes with constructors.

### <a name="Rh-dtor"></a>C.127: A class with a virtual function should have a virtual or protected destructor

##### Reason

A class with a virtual function is usually (and in general) used via a pointer to base. Usually, the last user has to call delete on a pointer to base, often via a smart pointer to base, so the destructor should be public and virtual. Less commonly, if deletion through a pointer to base is not intended to be supported, the destructor should be protected and nonvirtual; see [C.35](#Rc-dtor-virtual).

##### Example, bad

    struct B {
        virtual int f() = 0;
        // ... no user-written destructor, defaults to public nonvirtual ...
    };

    // bad: derived from a class without a virtual destructor
    struct D : B {
        string s {"default"};
    };

    void use()
    {
        unique_ptr<B> p = make_unique<D>();
        // ...
    } // undefined behavior. May call B::~B only and leak the string

##### Note

There are people who don't follow this rule because they plan to use a class only through a `shared_ptr`: `std::shared_ptr<B> p = std::make_shared<D>(args);` Here, the shared pointer will take care of deletion, so no leak will occur from an inappropriate `delete` of the base. People who do this consistently can get a false positive, but the rule is important -- what if one was allocated using `make_unique`? It's not safe unless the author of `B` ensures that it can never be misused, such as by making all constructors private and providing a factory function to enforce the allocation with `make_shared`.

##### Enforcement

* A class with any virtual functions should have a destructor that is either public and virtual or else protected and nonvirtual.
* Flag `delete` of a class with a virtual function but no virtual destructor.

### <a name="Rh-override"></a>C.128: Virtual functions should specify exactly one of `virtual`, `override`, or `final`

##### Reason

Readability.
Detection of mistakes.
Writing explicit `virtual`, `override`, or `final` is self-documenting and enables the compiler to catch mismatch of types and/or names between base and derived classes. However, writing more than one of these three is both redundant and a potential source of errors.

Use `virtual` only when declaring a new virtual function. Use `override` only when declaring an overrider. Use `final` only when declaring a final overrider. If a base class destructor is declared `virtual`, derived class destructors should neither be declared `virtual` nor `override`.

##### Example, bad

    struct B {
        void f1(int);
        virtual void f2(int) const;
        virtual void f3(int);
        // ...
    };

    struct D : B {
        void f1(int);        // bad (hope for a warning): D::f1() hides B::f1()
        void f2(int) const;  // bad (but conventional and valid): no explicit override
        void f3(double);     // bad (hope for a warning): D::f3() hides B::f3()
        // ...
    };

    struct Better : B {
        void f1(int) override;        // error (caught): D::f1() hides B::f1()
        void f2(int) const override;
        void f3(double) override;     // error (caught): D::f3() hides B::f3()
        // ...
    };

##### Enforcement

* Compare names in base and derived classes and flag uses of the same name that does not override.
* Flag overrides with neither `override` nor `final`.
* Flag function declarations that use more than one of `virtual`, `override`, and `final`.

### <a name="Rh-kind"></a>C.129: When designing a class hierarchy, distinguish between implementation inheritance and interface inheritance

##### Reason

Implementation details in an interface makes the interface brittle;
that is, makes its users vulnerable to having to recompile after changes in the implementation.
Data in a base class increases the complexity of implementing the base and can lead to replication of code.

##### Note

Definition:

* interface inheritance is the use of inheritance to separate users from implementations,
in particular to allow derived classes to be added and changed without affecting the users of base classes.
* implementation inheritance is the use of inheritance to simplify implementation of new facilities
by making useful operations available for implementers of related new operations (sometimes called "programming by difference").

A pure interface class is simply a set of pure virtual functions; see [I.25](#Ri-abstract).

In early OOP (e.g., in the 1980s and 1990s), implementation inheritance and interface inheritance were often mixed
and bad habits die hard.
Even now, mixtures are not uncommon in old code bases and in old-style teaching material.

The importance of keeping the two kinds of inheritance increases

* with the size of a hierarchy (e.g., dozens of derived classes),
* with the length of time the hierarchy is used (e.g., decades), and
* with the number of distinct organizations in which a hierarchy is used
(e.g., it can be difficult to distribute an update to a base class)


##### Example, bad

    class Shape {   // BAD, mixed interface and implementation
    public:
        Shape();
        Shape(Point ce = {0, 0}, Color co = none): cent{ce}, col {co} { /* ... */}

        Point center() const { return cent; }
        Color color() const { return col; }

        virtual void rotate(int) = 0;
        virtual void move(Point p) { cent = p; redraw(); }

        virtual void redraw();

        // ...
    public:
        Point cent;
        Color col;
    };

    class Circle : public Shape {
    public:
        Circle(Point c, int r) :Shape{c}, rad{r} { /* ... */ }

        // ...
    private:
        int rad;
    };

    class Triangle : public Shape {
    public:
        Triangle(Point p1, Point p2, Point p3); // calculate center
        // ...
    };

Problems:

* As the hierarchy grows and more data is added to `Shape`, the constructors gets harder to write and maintain.
* Why calculate the center for the `Triangle`? we may never us it.
* Add a data member to `Shape` (e.g., drawing style or canvas)
and all derived classes and all users needs to be reviewed, possibly changes, and probably recompiled.

The implementation of `Shape::move()` is an example of implementation inheritance:
we have defined `move()` once and for all for all derived classes.
The more code there is in such base class member function implementations and the more data is shared by placing it in the base,
the more benefits we gain - and the less stable the hierarchy is.

##### Example

This Shape hierarchy can be rewritten using interface inheritance:

    class Shape {  // pure interface
    public:
        virtual Point center() const = 0;
        virtual Color color() const = 0;

        virtual void rotate(int) = 0;
        virtual void move(Point p) = 0;

        virtual void redraw() = 0;

        // ...
    };

Note that a pure interface rarely have constructors: there is nothing to construct.

    class Circle : public Shape {
    public:
        Circle(Point c, int r, Color c) :cent{c}, rad{r}, col{c} { /* ... */ }

        Point center() const override { return cent; }
        Color color() const override { return col; }

        // ...
    private:
        Point cent;
        int rad;
        Color col;
    };

The interface is now less brittle, but there is more work in implementing the member functions.
For example, `center` has to be implemented by every class derived from `Shape`.

##### Example, dual hierarchy

How can we gain the benefit of the stable hierarchies from implementation hierarchies and the benefit of implementation reuse from implementation inheritance.
One popular technique is dual hierarchies.
There are many ways of implementing the idea of dual hierarchies; here, we use a multiple-inheritance variant.

First we devise a hierarchy of interface classes:

    class Shape {   // pure interface
    public:
        virtual Point center() const = 0;
        virtual Color color() const = 0;

        virtual void rotate(int) = 0;
        virtual void move(Point p) = 0;

        virtual void redraw() = 0;

        // ...
    };

    class Circle : public Shape {   // pure interface
    public:
        int radius() = 0;
        // ...
    };

To make this interface useful, we must provide its implementation classes (here, named equivalently, but in the `Impl` namespace):

    class Impl::Shape : public Shape { // implementation
    public:
        // constructors, destructor
        // ...
        virtual Point center() const { /* ... */ }
        virtual Color color() const { /* ... */ }

        virtual void rotate(int) { /* ... */ }
        virtual void move(Point p) { /* ... */ }

        virtual void redraw() { /* ... */ }

        // ...
    };

Now `Shape` is a poor example of a class with an implementation,
but bear with us because this is just a simple example of a technique aimed at more complex hierarchies.

    class Impl::Circle : public Circle, public Impl::Shape {   // implementation
    public:
        // constructors, destructor

        int radius() { /* ... */ }
        // ...
    };

And we could extend the hierarchies by adding a Smiley class (:-)):

    class Smiley : public Circle { // pure interface
    public:
        // ...
    };

    class Impl::Smiley : Public Smiley, public Impl::Circle {   // implementation
    public:
        // constructors, destructor
        // ...
    }

There are now two hierarchies:

* interface: Smiley -> Circle -> Shape
* implementation: Impl::Smiley -> Impl::Circle -> Impl::Shape

Since each implementation derived from its interface as well as its implementation base class we get a lattice (DAG):

    Smiley     ->         Circle     ->  Shape
      ^                     ^               ^
      |                     |               |
    Impl::Smiley -> Impl::Circle -> Impl::Shape

As mentioned, this is just one way to construct a dual hierarchy.

Another (related) technique for separating interface and implementation is [PIMPL](#???).

##### Note

There is often a choice between offering common functionality as (implemented) base class functions and free-standing functions
(in an implementation namespace).
Base classes gives a shorter notation and easier access to shared data (in the base)
at the cost of the functionality being available only to users of the hierarchy.

##### Enforcement

* Flag a derived to base conversion to a base with both data and virtual functions
(except for calls from a derived class member to a base class member)
* ???


### <a name="Rh-copy"></a>C.130: Redefine or prohibit copying for a base class; prefer a virtual `clone` function instead

##### Reason

Copying a base is usually slicing. If you really need copy semantics, copy deeply: Provide a virtual `clone` function that will copy the actual most-derived type and return an owning pointer to the new object, and then in derived classes return the derived type (use a covariant return type).

##### Example

    class Base {
    public:
        virtual owner<Base*> clone() = 0;
        virtual ~Base() = 0;

        Base(const Base&) = delete;
        Base& operator=(const Base&) = delete;
    };

    class Derived : public Base {
    public:
        owner<Derived*> clone() override;
        virtual ~Derived() override;
    };

Note that because of language rules, the covariant return type cannot be a smart pointer. See also [C.67](#Rc-copy-virtual).

##### Enforcement

* Flag a class with a virtual function and a non-user-defined copy operation.
* Flag an assignment of base class objects (objects of a class from which another has been derived).

### <a name="Rh-get"></a>C.131: Avoid trivial getters and setters

##### Reason

A trivial getter or setter adds no semantic value; the data item could just as well be `public`.

##### Example

    class Point {   // Bad: verbose
        int x;
        int y;
    public:
        Point(int xx, int yy) : x{xx}, y{yy} { }
        int get_x() const { return x; }
        void set_x(int xx) { x = xx; }
        int get_y() const { return y; }
        void set_y(int yy) { y = yy; }
        // no behavioral member functions
    };

Consider making such a class a `struct` -- that is, a behaviorless bunch of variables, all public data and no member functions.

    struct Point {
        int x {0};
        int y {0};
    };

Note that we can put default initializers on member variables: [C.49: Prefer initialization to assignment in constructors](#Rc-initialize).

##### Note

The key to this rule is whether the semantics of the getter/setter are trivial. While it is not a complete definition of "trivial", consider whether there would be any difference beyond syntax if the getter/setter was a public data member instead. Examples of non-trival semantics would be: maintaining a class invariant or converting between an internal type and an interface type.

##### Enforcement

Flag multiple `get` and `set` member functions that simply access a member without additional semantics.

### <a name="Rh-virtual"></a>C.132: Don't make a function `virtual` without reason

##### Reason

Redundant `virtual` increases run-time and object-code size.
A virtual function can be overridden and is thus open to mistakes in a derived class.
A virtual function ensures code replication in a templated hierarchy.

##### Example, bad

    template<class T>
    class Vector {
    public:
        // ...
        virtual int size() const { return sz; }   // bad: what good could a derived class do?
    private:
        T* elem;   // the elements
        int sz;    // number of elements
    };

This kind of "vector" isn't meant to be used as a base class at all.

##### Enforcement

* Flag a class with virtual functions but no derived classes.
* Flag a class where all member functions are virtual and have implementations.

### <a name="Rh-protected"></a>C.133: Avoid `protected` data

##### Reason

`protected` data is a source of complexity and errors.
`protected` data complicated the statement of invariants.
`protected` data inherently violates the guidance against putting data in base classes, which usually leads to having to deal virtual inheritance as well.

##### Example

    ???

##### Note

Protected member function can be just fine.

##### Enforcement

Flag classes with `protected` data.

### <a name="Rh-public"></a>C.134: Ensure all non-`const` data members have the same access level

##### Reason

Prevention of logical confusion leading to errors.
If the non-`const` data members don't have the same access level, the type is confused about what it's trying to do.
Is it a type that maintains an invariant or simply a collection of values?

##### Discussion

The core question is: What code is responsible for maintaining a meaningful/correct value for that variable?

There are exactly two kinds of data members:

* A: Ones that don't participate in the object's invariant. Any combination of values for these members is valid.
* B: Ones that do participate in the object's invariant. Not every combination of values is meaningful (else there'd be no invariant). Therefore all code that has write access to these variables must know about the invariant, know the semantics, and know (and actively implement and enforce) the rules for keeping the values correct.

Data members in category A should just be `public` (or, more rarely, `protected` if you only want derived classes to see them). They don't need encapsulation. All code in the system might as well see and manipulate them.

Data members in category B should be `private` or `const`. This is because encapsulation is important. To make them non-`private` and non-`const` would mean that the object can't control its own state: An unbounded amount of code beyond the class would need to know about the invariant and participate in maintaining it accurately -- if these data members were `public`, that would be all calling code that uses the object; if they were `protected`, it would be all the code in current and future derived classes. This leads to brittle and tightly coupled code that quickly becomes a nightmare to maintain. Any code that inadvertently sets the data members to an invalid or unexpected combination of values would corrupt the object and all subsequent uses of the object.

Most classes are either all A or all B:

* *All public*: If you're writing an aggregate bundle-of-variables without an invariant across those variables, then all the variables should be `public`.
  [By convention, declare such classes `struct` rather than `class`](#Rc-struct)
* *All private*: If you're writing a type that maintains an invariant, then all the non-`const` variables should be private -- it should be encapsulated.

##### Exception

Occasionally classes will mix A and B, usually for debug reasons. An encapsulated object may contain something like non-`const` debug instrumentation that isn't part of the invariant and so falls into category A -- it isn't really part of the object's value or meaningful observable state either. In that case, the A parts should be treated as A's (made `public`, or in rarer cases `protected` if they should be visible only to derived classes) and the B parts should still be treated like B's (`private` or `const`).

##### Enforcement

Flag any class that has non-`const` data members with different access levels.

### <a name="Rh-mi-interface"></a>C.135: Use multiple inheritance to represent multiple distinct interfaces

##### Reason

Not all classes will necessarily support all interfaces, and not all callers will necessarily want to deal with all operations.
Especially to break apart monolithic interfaces into "aspects" of behavior supported by a given derived class.

##### Example

    class iostream : public istream, public ostream {   // very simplified
        // ...
    };

`istream` provides the interface to input operations; `ostream` provides the interface to output operations.
`iostream` provides the union of the `istream` and `ostream` interfaces and the synchronization needed to allow both on a single stream. 

##### Note

This is a very common use of inheritance because the need for multiple different interfaces to an implementation is common
and such interfaces are often not easily or naturally organized into a single-rooted hierarchy.

##### Note

Such interfaces are typically abstract classes.

##### Enforcement

???

### <a name="Rh-mi-implementation"></a>C.136: Use multiple inheritance to represent the union of implementation attributes

##### Reason

Some forms of mixins have state and often operations on that state.
If the operations are virtual the use of inheritance is necessary, if not using inheritance can avoid boilerplate and forwarding.

##### Example

      class iostream : public istream, public ostream {   // very simplified
        // ...
    };

`istream` provides the interface to input operations (and some data); `ostream` provides the interface to output operations (and some data).
`iostream` provides the union of the `istream` and `ostream` interfaces and the synchronization needed to allow both on a single stream. 

##### Note

This a relatively rare use because implementation can often be organized into a single-rooted hierarchy.

##### Example

Sometimes, an "implementation attribute" is more like a "mixin" that determine the behavior of an implementation and inject
members to enable the implementation of the policies it requires. 
For example, see `std::enable_shared_from_this`
or various bases from boost.intrusive (e.g. `list_base_hook` or `intrusive_ref_counter`).

### <a name="Rh-using"></a>C.138: Create an overload set for a derived class and its bases with `using`

##### Reason

Without a using declaration, member functions in the derived class hide the entire inherited overload sets.

##### Example, bad

    #include <iostream>
    class B {
    public:
        virtual int f(int i) { std::cout << "f(int): "; return i; }
        virtual double f(double d) { std::cout << "f(double): "; return d; }
    };
    class D: public B {
    public:
        int f(int i) override { std::cout << "f(int): "; return i+1; }
    };
    int main()
    {
        D d;
        std::cout << d.f(2) << '\n';   // prints "f(int): 3"
        std::cout << d.f(2.3) << '\n'; // prints "f(int): 3"
    }

##### Example, good

    class D: public B {
    public:
        int f(int i) override { std::cout << "f(int): "; return i+1; }
        using B::f; // exposes f(double)
    };

##### Note

This issue affects both virtual and non-virtual member functions

For variadic bases, C++17 introduced a variadic form of the using-declaration,

    template <class... Ts>
    struct Overloader : Ts... {
        using Ts::operator()...; // exposes operator() from every base
    };

##### Enforcement

Diagnose name hiding

### <a name="Rh-final"></a>C.139: Use `final` sparingly

##### Reason

Capping a hierarchy with `final` is rarely needed for logical reasons and can be damaging to the extensibility of a hierarchy.
Capping an individual virtual function with `final` is error-prone as that `final` can easily be overlooked when defining/overriding a set of functions.

##### Example, bad

    class Widget { /* ... */ };

    // nobody will ever want to improve My_widget (or so you thought)
    class My_widget final : public Widget { /* ... */ };

    class My_improved_widget : public My_widget { /* ... */ };  // error: can't do that

##### Example, bad

    struct Interface {
        virtual int f() = 0;
        virtual int g() = 0;
    };

    class My_implementation : public Interface {
        int f() override;
        int g() final;  // I want g() to be FAST!
        // ...
    };

    class Better_implementation : public My_implementation {
        int f();
        int g();
        // ...
    };

    void use(Interface* p)
    {
        int x = p->f();    // Better_implementation::f()
        int y = p->g();    // My_implementation::g() Surprise?
    }

    // ...

    use(new Better_implementation{});

The problem is easy to see in a small example, but in a large hierarchy with many virtual functions, tools are required for reliably spotting such problems.
Consistent use of `override` would catch this.

##### Note

Claims of performance improvements from `final` should be substantiated.
Too often, such claims are based on conjecture or experience with other languages.

There are examples where `final` can be important for both logical and performance reasons.
One example is a performance-critical AST hierarchy in a compiler or language analysis tool.
New derived classes are not added every year and only by library implementers.
However, misuses are (or at least have been) far more common.

##### Enforcement

Flag uses of `final`.


## <a name="Rh-virtual-default-arg"></a>C.140: Do not provide different default arguments for a virtual function and an overrider

##### Reason

That can cause confusion: An overrider does not inherit default arguments.

##### Example, bad

    class Base {
    public:
        virtual int multiply(int value, int factor = 2) = 0;
    };

    class Derived : public Base {
    public:
        int multiply(int value, int factor = 10) override;
    };

    Derived d;
    Base& b = d;

    b.multiply(10);  // these two calls will call the same function but
    d.multiply(10);  // with different arguments and so different results

##### Enforcement

Flag default arguments on virtual functions if they differ between base and derived declarations.

## C.hier-access: Accessing objects in a hierarchy

### <a name="Rh-poly"></a>C.145: Access polymorphic objects through pointers and references

##### Reason

If you have a class with a virtual function, you don't (in general) know which class provided the function to be used.

##### Example

    struct B { int a; virtual int f(); };
    struct D : B { int b; int f() override; };

    void use(B b)
    {
        D d;
        B b2 = d;   // slice
        B b3 = b;
    }

    void use2()
    {
        D d;
        use(d);   // slice
    }

Both `d`s are sliced.

##### Exception

You can safely access a named polymorphic object in the scope of its definition, just don't slice it.

    void use3()
    {
        D d;
        d.f();   // OK
    }

##### Enforcement

Flag all slicing.

### <a name="Rh-dynamic_cast"></a>C.146: Use `dynamic_cast` where class hierarchy navigation is unavoidable

##### Reason

`dynamic_cast` is checked at run time.

##### Example

    struct B {   // an interface
        virtual void f();
        virtual void g();
    };

    struct D : B {   // a wider interface
        void f() override;
        virtual void h();
    };

    void user(B* pb)
    {
        if (D* pd = dynamic_cast<D*>(pb)) {
            // ... use D's interface ...
        }
        else {
            // ... make do with B's interface ...
        }
    }

##### Note

Like other casts, `dynamic_cast` is overused.
[Prefer virtual functions to casting](#???).
Prefer [static polymorphism](#???) to hierarchy navigation where it is possible (no run-time resolution necessary)
and reasonably convenient.

##### Note

Some people use `dynamic_cast` where a `typeid` would have been more appropriate;
`dynamic_cast` is a general "is kind of" operation for discovering the best interface to an object,
whereas `typeid` is a "give me the exact type of this object" operation to discover the actual type of an object.
The latter is an inherently simpler operation that ought to be faster.
The latter (`typeid`) is easily hand-crafted if necessary (e.g., if working on a system where RTTI is -- for some reason -- prohibited),
the former (`dynamic_cast`) is far harder to implement correctly in general.

Consider:

    struct B {
        const char * name {"B"};
        virtual const char* id() const { return name; }
        // ...
    };

    struct D : B {
        const char * name {"D"};
        const char* id() const override { return name; }
        // ...
    };

    void use()
    {
        B* pb1 = new B;
        B* pb2 = new D;

        cout << pb1->id(); // "B"
        cout << pb2->id(); // "D"

        if (pb1->id() == pb2->id()) // *pb1 is the same type as *pb2
        if (pb2->id() == "D") {         // looks innocent
            D* pd = static_cast<D*>(pb1);
            // ...
        }
        // ...
    }

The result of `pb2->id() == "D"` is actually implementation defined.
We added it to warn of the dangers of home-brew RTTI.
This code may work as expected for years, just to fail on a new machine, new compiler, or a new linker that does not unify character literals.

If you implement your own RTTI, be careful.

##### Exception

If your implementation provided a really slow `dynamic_cast`, you may have to use a workaround.
However, all workarounds that cannot be statically resolved involve explicit casting (typically `static_cast`) and are error-prone.
You will basically be crafting your own special-purpose `dynamic_cast`.
So, first make sure that your `dynamic_cast` really is as slow as you think it is (there are a fair number of unsupported rumors about)
and that your use of `dynamic_cast` is really performance critical.

We are of the opinion that current implementations of `dynamic_cast` are unnecessarily slow.
For example, under suitable conditions, it is possible to perform a `dynamic_cast` in [fast constant time](http://www.stroustrup.com/fast_dynamic_casting.pdf).
However, compatibility makes changes difficult even if all agree that an effort to optimize is worthwhile.

In very rare cases, if you have measured that the `dynamic_cast` overhead is material, you have other means to statically guarantee that a downcast will succeed (e.g., you are using CRTP carefully), and there is no virtual inheritance involved, consider tactically resorting `static_cast` with a prominent comment and disclaimer summarizing this paragraph and that human attention is needed under maintenance because the type system can't verify correctness. Even so, in our experience such "I know what I'm doing" situations are still a known bug source.

##### Enforcement

Flag all uses of `static_cast` for downcasts, including C-style casts that perform a `static_cast`.

### <a name="Rh-ptr-cast"></a>C.147: Use `dynamic_cast` to a reference type when failure to find the required class is considered an error

### <a name="Rh-smart"></a>C.149: Use `unique_ptr` or `shared_ptr` to avoid forgetting to `delete` objects created using `new`

##### Reason

Avoid resource leaks.

##### Example

    void use(int i)
    {
        auto p = new int {7};           // bad: initialize local pointers with new
        auto q = make_unique<int>(9);   // ok: guarantee the release of the memory allocated for 9
        if (0 < i) return;              // maybe return and leak
        delete p;                       // too late
    }

##### Enforcement

* Flag `delete` of local variable

### <a name="Rh-make_unique"></a>C.150: Use `make_unique()` to construct objects owned by `unique_ptr`s

##### Reason

 `make_unique` gives a more concise statement of the construction.
It also ensures exception safety in complex expressions.

##### Example

    unique_ptr<Foo> p {new<Foo>{7}};   // OK: but repetitive

    auto q = make_unique<Foo>(7);      // Better: no repetition of Foo

    // Not exception-safe: the compiler may interleave the computations of arguments as follows:
    //
    // 1. allocate memory for Foo,
    // 2. construct Foo,
    // 3. call bar,
    // 4. construct unique_ptr<Foo>.
    //
    // If bar throws, Foo will not be destroyed, and the memory allocated for it will leak.
    f(unique_ptr<Foo>(new Foo()), bar());

    // Exception-safe: calls to functions are never interleaved.
    f(make_unique<Foo>(), bar());

##### Enforcement

* Flag the repetitive usage of template specialization list `<Foo>`
* Flag variables declared to be `unique_ptr<Foo>`

### <a name="Rh-make_shared"></a>C.151: Use `make_shared()` to construct objects owned by `shared_ptr`s

##### Reason

 `make_shared` gives a more concise statement of the construction.
It also gives an opportunity to eliminate a separate allocation for the reference counts, by placing the `shared_ptr`'s use counts next to its object.

##### Example

    // OK: but repetitive; and separate allocations for the Foo and shared_ptr's use count
    shared_ptr<Foo> p {new<Foo>{7}};

    auto q = make_shared<Foo>(7);   // Better: no repetition of Foo; one object

##### Enforcement

* Flag the repetitive usage of template specialization list`<Foo>`
* Flag variables declared to be `shared_ptr<Foo>`

### <a name="Rh-array"></a>C.152: Never assign a pointer to an array of derived class objects to a pointer to its base

##### Reason

Subscripting the resulting base pointer will lead to invalid object access and probably to memory corruption.

##### Example

    struct B { int x; };
    struct D : B { int y; };

    void use(B*);

    D a[] = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5, 6}};
    B* p = a;     // bad: a decays to &a[0] which is converted to a B*
    p[1].x = 7;   // overwrite D[0].y

    use(a);       // bad: a decays to &a[0] which is converted to a B*

##### Enforcement

* Flag all combinations of array decay and base to derived conversions.
* Pass an array as a `span` rather than as a pointer, and don't let the array name suffer a derived-to-base conversion before getting into the `span`

## <a name="SS-overload"></a>C.over: Overloading and overloaded operators

You can overload ordinary functions, template functions, and operators.
You cannot overload function objects.

* [C.161: Use nonmember functions for symmetric operators](#Ro-symmetric)
* [C.162: Overload operations that are roughly equivalent](#Ro-equivalent)

* [C.170: If you feel like overloading a lambda, use a generic lambda](#Ro-lambda)

### <a name="Ro-conventional"></a>C.160: Define operators primarily to mimic conventional usage

##### Reason

Minimize surprises.

##### Example

    class X {
    public:
        // ...
        X& operator=(const X&); // member function defining assignment
        friend bool operator==(const X&, const X&); // == needs access to representation
                                                    // after a = b we have a == b
        // ...
    };

Here, the conventional semantics is maintained: [Copies compare equal](#SS-copy).

##### Example, bad

    X operator+(X a, X b) { return a.v - b.v; }   // bad: makes + subtract

##### Note

Non-member operators should be either friends or defined in [the same namespace as their operands](#Ro-namespace).
[Binary operators should treat their operands equivalently](#Ro-symmetric).

##### Enforcement

Possibly impossible.

### <a name="Ro-symmetric"></a>C.161: Use nonmember functions for symmetric operators

##### Reason

If you use member functions, you need two.
Unless you use a non-member function for (say) `==`, `a == b` and `b == a` will be subtly different.

##### Example

    bool operator==(Point a, Point b) { return a.x == b.x && a.y == b.y; }

##### Enforcement

Flag member operator functions.

### <a name="Ro-equivalent"></a>C.162: Overload operations that are roughly equivalent

##### Reason

Having different names for logically equivalent operations on different argument types is confusing, leads to encoding type information in function names, and inhibits generic programming.

##### Example

Consider:

    void print(int a);
    void print(int a, int base);
    void print(const string&);

These three functions all print their arguments (appropriately). Conversely:

    void print_int(int a);
    void print_based(int a, int base);
    void print_string(const string&);

These three functions all print their arguments (appropriately). Adding to the name just introduced verbosity and inhibits generic code.

##### Enforcement

???

### <a name="Ro-equivalent-2"></a>C.163: Overload only for operations that are roughly equivalent

##### Reason

Having the same name for logically different functions is confusing and leads to errors when using generic programming.

##### Example

Consider:

    void open_gate(Gate& g);   // remove obstacle from garage exit lane
    void fopen(const char* name, const char* mode);   // open file

The two operations are fundamentally different (and unrelated) so it is good that their names differ. Conversely:

    void open(Gate& g);   // remove obstacle from garage exit lane
    void open(const char* name, const char* mode ="r");   // open file

The two operations are still fundamentally different (and unrelated) but the names have been reduced to their (common) minimum, opening opportunities for confusion.
Fortunately, the type system will catch many such mistakes.

##### Note

Be particularly careful about common and popular names, such as `open`, `move`, `+`, and `==`.

### <a name="Ro-conversion"></a>C.164: Avoid conversion operators

##### Reason

Implicit conversions can be essential (e.g., `double` to `int`) but often cause surprises (e.g., `String` to C-style string).

##### Note

Prefer explicitly named conversions until a serious need is demonstrated.
By "serious need" we mean a reason that is fundamental in the application domain (such as an integer to complex number conversion)
and frequently needed. Do not introduce implicit conversions (through conversion operators or non-`explicit` constructors)
just to gain a minor convenience.

##### Example, bad

    class String {   // handle ownership and access to a sequence of characters
        // ...
        String(czstring p); // copy from *p to *(this->elem)
        // ...
        operator zstring() { return elem; }
        // ...
    };

    void user(zstring p)
    {
        if (*p == "") {
            String s {"Trouble ahead!"};
            // ...
            p = s;
        }
        // use p
    }

The string allocated for `s` and assigned to `p` is destroyed before it can be used.

##### Enforcement

Flag all conversion operators.

### <a name="Ro-custom"></a>C.165: Use `using` for customization points

##### Reason

To find function objects and functions defined in a separate namespace to "customize" a common function.

##### Example

Consider `swap`. It is a general (standard library) function with a definition that will work for just about any type.
However, it is desirable to define specific `swap()`s for specific types.
For example, the general `swap()` will copy the elements of two `vector`s being swapped, whereas a good specific implementation will not copy elements at all.

    namespace N {
        My_type X { /* ... */ };
        void swap(X&, X&);   // optimized swap for N::X
        // ...
    }

    void f1(N::X& a, N::X& b)
    {
        std::swap(a, b);   // probably not what we wanted: calls std::swap()
    }

The `std::swap()` in `f1()` does exactly what we asked it to do: it calls the `swap()` in namespace `std`.
Unfortunately, that's probably not what we wanted.
How do we get `N::X` considered?

    void f2(N::X& a, N::X& b)
    {
        swap(a, b);   // calls N::swap
    }

But that may not be what we wanted for generic code.
There, we typically want the specific function if it exists and the general function if not.
This is done by including the general function in the lookup for the function:

    void f3(N::X& a, N::X& b)
    {
        using std::swap;  // make std::swap available
        swap(a, b);        // calls N::swap if it exists, otherwise std::swap
    }

##### Enforcement

Unlikely, except for known customization points, such as `swap`.
The problem is that the unqualified and qualified lookups both have uses.

### <a name="Ro-address-of"></a>C.166: Overload unary `&` only as part of a system of smart pointers and references

##### Reason

The `&` operator is fundamental in C++.
Many parts of the C++ semantics assumes its default meaning.

##### Example

    class Ptr { // a somewhat smart pointer
        Ptr(X* pp) :p(pp) { /* check */ }
        X* operator->() { /* check */ return p; }
        X operator[](int i);
        X operator*();
    private:
        T* p;
    };

    class X {
        Ptr operator&() { return Ptr{this}; }
        // ...
    };

##### Note

If you "mess with" operator `&` be sure that its definition has matching meanings for `->`, `[]`, `*`, and `.` on the result type.
Note that operator `.` currently cannot be overloaded so a perfect system is impossible.
We hope to remedy that: <http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/n4477.pdf>.
Note that `std::addressof()` always yields a built-in pointer.

##### Enforcement

Tricky. Warn if `&` is user-defined without also defining `->` for the result type.

### <a name="Ro-namespace"></a>C.168: Define overloaded operators in the namespace of their operands

##### Reason

Readability.
Ability for find operators using ADL.
Avoiding inconsistent definition in different namespaces

##### Example

    struct S { };
    bool operator==(S, S);   // OK: in the same namespace as S, and even next to S
    S s;

    bool x = (s == s);

This is what a default `==` would do, if we had such defaults.

##### Example

    namespace N {
        struct S { };
        bool operator==(S, S);   // OK: in the same namespace as S, and even next to S
    }

    N::S s;

    bool x = (s == s);  // finds N::operator==() by ADL

##### Example, bad

    struct S { };
    S s;

    namespace N {
        S::operator!(S a) { return true; }
        S not_s = !s;
    }

    namespace M {
        S::operator!(S a) { return false; }
        S not_s = !s;
    }

Here, the meaning of `!s` differs in `N` and `M`.
This can be most confusing.
Remove the definition of `namespace M` and the confusion is replaced by an opportunity to make the mistake.

##### Note

If a binary operator is defined for two types that are defined in different namespaces, you cannot follow this rule.
For example:

    Vec::Vector operator*(const Vec::Vector&, const Mat::Matrix&);

This may be something best avoided.

##### See also

This is a special case of the rule that [helper functions should be defined in the same namespace as their class](#Rc-helper).

##### Enforcement

* Flag operator definitions that are not it the namespace of their operands

### <a name="Ro-overload"></a>C.167: Use an operator for an operation with its conventional meaning

##### Reason

Readability. Convention. Reusability. Support for generic code

##### Example

    void cout_my_class(const My_class& c) // confusing, not conventional,not generic
    {
        std::cout << /* class members here */;
    }

    std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, const my_class& c) // OK
    {
        return os << /* class members here */;
    }

By itself, `cout_my_class` would be OK, but it is not usable/composable with code that rely on the `<<` convention for output:

    My_class var { /* ... */ };
    // ...
    cout << "var = " << var << '\n';

##### Note

There are strong and vigorous conventions for the meaning most operators, such as

* comparisons (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=`),
* arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%`)
* access operations (`.`, `->`, unary `*`, and `[]`)
* assignment (`=`)

Don't define those unconventionally and don't invent your own names for them.

##### Enforcement

Tricky. Requires semantic insight.

### <a name="Ro-lambda"></a>C.170: If you feel like overloading a lambda, use a generic lambda

##### Reason

You cannot overload by defining two different lambdas with the same name.

##### Example

    void f(int);
    void f(double);
    auto f = [](char);   // error: cannot overload variable and function

    auto g = [](int) { /* ... */ };
    auto g = [](double) { /* ... */ };   // error: cannot overload variables

    auto h = [](auto) { /* ... */ };   // OK

##### Enforcement

The compiler catches the attempt to overload a lambda.

## <a name="SS-union"></a>C.union: Unions

A `union` is a `struct` where all members start at the same address so that it can hold only one member at a time.
A `union` does not keep track of which member is stored so the programmer has to get it right;
this is inherently error-prone, but there are ways to compensate.

A type that is a `union` plus an indicator of which member is currently held is called a *tagged union*, a *discriminated union*, or a *variant*.

Union rule summary:

* [C.180: Use `union`s to save Memory](#Ru-union)
* [C.181: Avoid "naked" `union`s](#Ru-naked)
* [C.182: Use anonymous `union`s to implement tagged unions](#Ru-anonymous)
* [C.183: Don't use a `union` for type punning](#Ru-pun)
* ???

### <a name="Ru-union"></a>C.180: Use `union`s to save memory

##### Reason

A `union` allows a single piece of memory to be used for different types of objects at different times.
Consequently, it can be used to save memory when we have several objects that are never used at the same time.

##### Example

    union Value {
        int x;
        double d;
    };

    Value v = { 123 };  // now v holds an int
    cout << v.x << '\n';    // write 123
    v.d = 987.654;  // now v holds a double
    cout << v.d << '\n';    // write 987.654

But heed the warning: [Avoid "naked" `union`s](#Ru-naked)

##### Example

    // Short-string optimization

    constexpr size_t buffer_size = 16; // Slightly larger than the size of a pointer

    class Immutable_string {
    public:
        Immutable_string(const char* str) :
            size(strlen(str))
        {
            if (size < buffer_size)
                strcpy_s(string_buffer, buffer_size, str);
            else {
                string_ptr = new char[size + 1];
                strcpy_s(string_ptr, size + 1, str);
            }
        }

        ~Immutable_string()
        {
            if (size >= buffer_size)
                delete string_ptr;
        }

        const char* get_str() const
        {
            return (size < buffer_size) ? string_buffer : string_ptr;
        }

    private:
        // If the string is short enough, we store the string itself
        // instead of a pointer to the string.
        union {
            char* string_ptr;
            char string_buffer[buffer_size];
        };

        const size_t size;
    };

##### Enforcement

### <a name="Ru-naked"></a>C.181: Avoid "naked" `union`s

##### Reason

A *naked union* is a union without an associated indicator which member (if any) it holds,
so that the programmer has to keep track.
Naked unions are a source of type errors.

###### Example, bad

    union Value {
        int x;
        double d;
    };

    Value v;
    v.d = 987.654;  // v holds a double

So far, so good, but we can easily misuse the `union`:

    cout << v.x << '\n';    // BAD, undefined behavior: v holds a double, but we read it as an int

Note that the type error happened without any explicit cast.
When we tested that program the last value printed was `1683627180` which it the integer value for the bit pattern for `987.654`.
What we have here is an "invisible" type error that happens to give a result that could easily look innocent.

And, talking about "invisible", this code produced no output:

    v.x = 123;
    cout << v.d << '\n';    // BAD: undefined behavior

###### Alternative

Wrap a `union` in a class together with a type field.

The soon-to-be-standard `variant` type (to be found in `<variant>`) does that for you:

    variant<int, double> v;
    v = 123;        // v holds an int
    int x = get<int>(v);
    v = 123.456;    // v holds a double
    w = get<double>(v);

##### Enforcement

### <a name="Ru-anonymous"></a>C.182: Use anonymous `union`s to implement tagged unions

##### Reason

A well-designed tagged union is type safe.
An *anonymous* union simplifies the definition of a class with a (tag, union) pair.

##### Example

This example is mostly borrowed from TC++PL4 pp216-218.
You can look there for an explanation.

The code is somewhat elaborate.
Handling a type with user-defined assignment and destructor is tricky.
Saving programmers from having to write such code is one reason for including `variant` in the standard.

    class Value { // two alternative representations represented as a union
    private:
        enum class Tag { number, text };
        Tag type; // discriminant

        union { // representation (note: anonymous union)
            int i;
            string s; // string has default constructor, copy operations, and destructor
        };
    public:
        struct Bad_entry { }; // used for exceptions

        ~Value();
        Value& operator=(const Value&);   // necessary because of the string variant
        Value(const Value&);
        // ...
        int number() const;
        string text() const;

        void set_number(int n);
        void set_text(const string&);
        // ...
    };

    int Value::number() const
    {
        if (type != Tag::number) throw Bad_entry{};
        return i;
    }

    string Value::text() const
    {
        if (type != Tag::text) throw Bad_entry{};
        return s;
    }

    void Value::set_number(int n)
    {
        if (type == Tag::text) {
            s.~string();      // explicitly destroy string
            type = Tag::number;
        }
        i = n;
    }

    void Value::set_text(const string& ss)
    {
        if (type == Tag::text)
            s = ss;
        else {
            new(&s) string{ss};   // placement new: explicitly construct string
            type = Tag::text;
        }
    }

    Value& Value::operator=(const Value& e)   // necessary because of the string variant
    {
        if (type == Tag::text && e.type == Tag::text) {
            s = e.s;    // usual string assignment
            return *this;
        }

        if (type == Tag::text) s.~string(); // explicit destroy

        switch (e.type) {
        case Tag::number:
            i = e.i;
            break;
        case Tag::text:
            new(&s)(e.s);   // placement new: explicit construct
            type = e.type;
        }

        return *this;
    }

    Value::~Value()
    {
        if (type == Tag::text) s.~string(); // explicit destroy
    }

### <a name="Ru-pun"></a>C.183: Don't use a `union` for type punning

##### Reason

It is undefined behavior to read a `union` member with a different type from the one with which it was written.
Such punning is invisible, or at least harder to spot than using a named cast.
Type punning using a `union` is a source of errors.

##### Example, bad

    union Pun {
        int x;
        unsigned char c[sizeof(int)];
    };

The idea of `Pun` is to be able to look at the character representation of an `int`.

    void bad(Pun& u)
    {
        u.x = 'x';
        cout << u.c[0] << '\n';     // undefined behavior
    }

If you wanted to see the bytes of an `int`, use a (named) cast:

    void if_you_must_pun(int& x)
    {
        auto p = reinterpret_cast<unsigned char*>(&x);
        cout << p[0] << '\n';     // undefined behavior
        // ...
    }

Accessing the result of an `reinterpret_cast` to a different type from the objects declared type is still undefined behavior,
but at least we can see that something tricky is going on.

##### Note

Unfortunately, `union`s are commonly used for type punning.
We don't consider "sometimes, it works as expected" a strong argument.
