# <span id="S-functions"></span>F: Functions

A function specifies an action or a computation that takes the system from one consistent state to the next. It is the fundamental building block of programs.

It should be possible to name a function meaningfully, to specify the requirements of its argument, and clearly state the relationship between the arguments and the result. An implementation is not a specification. Try to think about what a function does as well as about how it does it.
Functions are the most critical part in most interfaces, so see the interface rules.

Function rule summary:

Function definition rules:

* [F.1: "Package" meaningful operations as carefully named functions](#Rf-package)
* [F.2: A function should perform a single logical operation](#Rf-logical)
* [F.3: Keep functions short and simple](#Rf-single)

* [F.22: Use `T*` or `owner<T*>` or a smart pointer to designate a single object](#Rf-ptr)
* [F.23: Use a `not_null<T>` to indicate "null" is not a valid value](#Rf-nullptr)
* [F.24: Use a `span<T>` or a `span_p<T>` to designate a half-open sequence](#Rf-range)

* [F.54: If you capture `this`, capture all variables explicitly (no default capture)](#Rf-this-capture)

Functions have strong similarities to lambdas and function objects so see also Section ???.

## <span id="SS-fct-def"></span>F.def: Function definitions

A function definition is a function declaration that also specifies the function's implementation, the function body.

### <span id="Rf-package"></span>F.1: "Package" meaningful operations as carefully named functions

##### Reason

Factoring out common code makes code more readable, more likely to be reused, and limit errors from complex code.
If something is a well-specified action, separate it out from its surrounding code and give it a name.

##### Example, don't

    void read_and_print(istream& is)    // read and print an int
    {
        int x;
        if (is >> x)
            cout << "the int is " << x << '\n';
        else
            cerr << "no int on input\n";
    }

Almost everything is wrong with `read_and_print`.
It reads, it writes (to a fixed `ostream`), it writes error messages (to a fixed `ostream`), it handles only `int`s.
There is nothing to reuse, logically separate operations are intermingled and local variables are in scope after the end of their logical use.
For a tiny example, this looks OK, but if the input operation, the output operation, and the error handling had been more complicated the tangled
mess could become hard to understand.

##### Note

If you write a non-trivial lambda that potentially can be used in more than one place, give it a name by assigning it to a (usually non-local) variable.

##### Example

    sort(a, b, [](T x, T y) { return x.rank() < y.rank() && x.value() < y.value(); });

Naming that lambda breaks up the expression into its logical parts and provides a strong hint to the meaning of the lambda.

    auto lessT = [](T x, T y) { return x.rank() < y.rank() && x.value() < y.value(); };

    sort(a, b, lessT);
    find_if(a, b, lessT);

The shortest code is not always the best for performance or maintainability.

##### Exception

Loop bodies, including lambdas used as loop bodies, rarely need to be named.
However, large loop bodies (e.g., dozens of lines or dozens of pages) can be a problem.
The rule [Keep functions short](#Rf-single) implies "Keep loop bodies short."
Similarly, lambdas used as callback arguments are sometimes non-trivial, yet unlikely to be re-usable.

##### Enforcement

* See [Keep functions short](#Rf-single)
* Flag identical and very similar lambdas used in different places.

### <span id="Rf-logical"></span>F.2: A function should perform a single logical operation

##### Reason

A function that performs a single operation is simpler to understand, test, and reuse.

##### Example

Consider:

    void read_and_print()    // bad
    {
        int x;
        cin >> x;
        // check for errors
        cout << x << "\n";
    }

This is a monolith that is tied to a specific input and will never find another (different) use. Instead, break functions up into suitable logical parts and parameterize:

    int read(istream& is)    // better
    {
        int x;
        is >> x;
        // check for errors
        return x;
    }

    void print(ostream& os, int x)
    {
        os << x << "\n";
    }

These can now be combined where needed:

    void read_and_print()
    {
        auto x = read(cin);
        print(cout, x);
    }

If there was a need, we could further templatize `read()` and `print()` on the data type, the I/O mechanism, the response to errors, etc. Example:

    auto read = [](auto& input, auto& value)    // better
    {
        input >> value;
        // check for errors
    };

    auto print(auto& output, const auto& value)
    {
        output << value << "\n";
    }

##### Enforcement

* Consider functions with more than one "out" parameter suspicious. Use return values instead, including `tuple` for multiple return values.
* Consider "large" functions that don't fit on one editor screen suspicious. Consider factoring such a function into smaller well-named suboperations.
* Consider functions with 7 or more parameters suspicious.

### <span id="Rf-single"></span>F.3: Keep functions short and simple

##### Reason

Large functions are hard to read, more likely to contain complex code, and more likely to have variables in larger than minimal scopes.
Functions with complex control structures are more likely to be long and more likely to hide logical errors

##### Example

Consider:

    double simpleFunc(double val, int flag1, int flag2)
        // simpleFunc: takes a value and calculates the expected ASIC output,
        // given the two mode flags.
    {
        double intermediate;
        if (flag1 > 0) {
            intermediate = func1(val);
            if (flag2 % 2)
                 intermediate = sqrt(intermediate);
        }
        else if (flag1 == -1) {
            intermediate = func1(-val);
            if (flag2 % 2)
                 intermediate = sqrt(-intermediate);
            flag1 = -flag1;
        }
        if (abs(flag2) > 10) {
            intermediate = func2(intermediate);
        }
        switch (flag2 / 10) {
            case 1: if (flag1 == -1) return finalize(intermediate, 1.171);
                    break;
            case 2: return finalize(intermediate, 13.1);
            default: break;
        }
        return finalize(intermediate, 0.);
    }

This is too complex (and long).
How would you know if all possible alternatives have been correctly handled?
Yes, it breaks other rules also.

We can refactor:

    double func1_muon(double val, int flag)
    {
        // ???
    }

    double funct1_tau(double val, int flag1, int flag2)
    {
        // ???
    }

    double simpleFunc(double val, int flag1, int flag2)
        // simpleFunc: takes a value and calculates the expected ASIC output,
        // given the two mode flags.
    {
        if (flag1 > 0)
            return func1_muon(val, flag2);
        if (flag1 == -1)
            // handled by func1_tau: flag1 = -flag1;
            return func1_tau(-val, flag1, flag2);
        return 0.;
    }

##### Note

"It doesn't fit on a screen" is often a good practical definition of "far too large."
One-to-five-line functions should be considered normal.

##### Note

Break large functions up into smaller cohesive and named functions.
Small simple functions are easily inlined where the cost of a function call is significant.

##### Enforcement

* Flag functions that do not "fit on a screen."
  How big is a screen? Try 60 lines by 140 characters; that's roughly the maximum that's comfortable for a book page.
* Flag functions that are too complex. How complex is too complex?
  You could use cyclomatic complexity. Try "more than 10 logical path through." Count a simple switch as one path.

### <span id="Rf-constexpr"></span>F.4: If a function may have to be evaluated at compile time, declare it `constexpr`

##### Reason

 `constexpr` is needed to tell the compiler to allow compile-time evaluation.

##### Example

The (in)famous factorial:

    constexpr int fac(int n)
    {
        constexpr int max_exp = 17;      // constexpr enables max_exp to be used in Expects
        Expects(0 <= n && n < max_exp);  // prevent silliness and overflow
        int x = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) x *= i;
        return x;
    }

This is C++14.
For C++11, use a recursive formulation of `fac()`.

##### Note

`constexpr` does not guarantee compile-time evaluation;
it just guarantees that the function can be evaluated at compile time for constant expression arguments if the programmer requires it or the compiler decides to do so to optimize.

    constexpr int min(int x, int y) { return x < y ? x : y; }

    void test(int v)
    {
        int m1 = min(-1, 2);            // probably compile-time evaluation
        constexpr int m2 = min(-1, 2);  // compile-time evaluation
        int m3 = min(-1, v);            // run-time evaluation
        constexpr int m4 = min(-1, v);  // error: cannot evaluate at compile-time
    }

##### Note

`constexpr` functions are pure: they can have no side effects.

    int dcount = 0;
    constexpr int double(int v)
    {
        ++dcount;   // error: attempted side effect from constexpr function
        return v + v;
    }

This is usually a very good thing.

When given a non-constant argument, a `constexpr` function can throw.
If you consider exiting by throwing a side-effect, a `constexpr` function isn't completely pure;
if not, this is not an issue.
??? A question for the committee: can a constructor for an exception thrown by a `constexpr` function modify state?
"No" would be a nice answer that matches most practice.

##### Note

Don't try to make all functions `constexpr`.
Most computation is best done at run time.

##### Note

Any API that may eventually depend on high-level runtime configuration or
business logic should not be made `constexpr`. Such customization can not be
evaluated by the compiler, and any `constexpr` functions that depended upon 
that API would have to be refactored or drop `constexpr`.

##### Enforcement

Impossible and unnecessary.
The compiler gives an error if a non-`constexpr` function is called where a constant is required.

### <span id="Rf-inline"></span>F.5: If a function is very small and time-critical, declare it `inline`

##### Reason

Some optimizers are good at inlining without hints from the programmer, but don't rely on it.
Measure! Over the last 40 years or so, we have been promised compilers that can inline better than humans without hints from humans.
We are still waiting.
Specifying `inline` encourages the compiler to do a better job.

##### Example

    inline string cat(const string& s, const string& s2) { return s + s2; }

##### Exception

Do not put an `inline` function in what is meant to be a stable interface unless you are certain that it will not change.
An inline function is part of the ABI.

##### Note

`constexpr` implies `inline`.

##### Note

Member functions defined in-class are `inline` by default.

##### Exception

Template functions (incl. template member functions) must be in headers and therefore inline.

##### Enforcement

Flag `inline` functions that are more than three statements and could have been declared out of line (such as class member functions).

### <span id="Rf-noexcept"></span>F.6: If your function may not throw, declare it `noexcept`

##### Reason

If an exception is not supposed to be thrown, the program cannot be assumed to cope with the error and should be terminated as soon as possible. Declaring a function `noexcept` helps optimizers by reducing the number of alternative execution paths. It also speeds up the exit after failure.

##### Example

Put `noexcept` on every function written completely in C or in any other language without exceptions.
The C++ standard library does that implicitly for all functions in the C standard library.

##### Note

`constexpr` functions can throw when evaluated at run time, so you may need `noexcept` for some of those.

##### Example

You can use `noexcept` even on functions that can throw:

    vector<string> collect(istream& is) noexcept
    {
        vector<string> res;
        for (string s; is >> s;)
            res.push_back(s);
        return res;
    }

If `collect()` runs out of memory, the program crashes.
Unless the program is crafted to survive memory exhaustion, that may be just the right thing to do;
`terminate()` may generate suitable error log information (but after memory runs out it is hard to do anything clever).

##### Note

You must be aware of the execution environment that your code is running when
deciding whether to tag a function `noexcept`, especially because of the issue
of throwing and allocation.  Code that is intended to be perfectly general (like
the standard library and other utility code of that sort) needs to support
environments where a `bad_alloc` exception may be handled meaningfully.
However, most programs and execution environments cannot meaningfully
handle a failure to allocate, and aborting the program is the cleanest and
simplest response to an allocation failure in those cases.  If you know that
your application code cannot respond to an allocation failure, it may be
appropriate to add `noexcept` even on functions that allocate.

Put another way: In most programs, most functions can throw (e.g., because they
use `new`, call functions that do, or use library functions that reports failure
by throwing), so don't just sprinkle `noexcept` all over the place without
considering whether the possible exceptions can be handled.

`noexcept` is most useful (and most clearly correct) for frequently used,
low-level functions.

##### Note

Destructors, `swap` functions, move operations, and default constructors should never throw.

##### Enforcement

* Flag functions that are not `noexcept`, yet cannot throw.
* Flag throwing `swap`, `move`, destructors, and default constructors.

### <span id="Rf-smart"></span>F.7: For general use, take `T*` or `T&` arguments rather than smart pointers

##### Reason

Passing a smart pointer transfers or shares ownership and should only be used when ownership semantics are intended (see [R.30](#Rr-smartptrparam)).
Passing by smart pointer restricts the use of a function to callers that use smart pointers.
Passing a shared smart pointer (e.g., `std::shared_ptr`) implies a run-time cost.

##### Example

    // accepts any int*
    void f(int*);

    // can only accept ints for which you want to transfer ownership
    void g(unique_ptr<int>);

    // can only accept ints for which you are willing to share ownership
    void g(shared_ptr<int>);

    // doesn't change ownership, but requires a particular ownership of the caller
    void h(const unique_ptr<int>&);

    // accepts any int
    void h(int&);

##### Example, bad

    // callee
    void f(shared_ptr<widget>& w)
    {
        // ...
        use(*w); // only use of w -- the lifetime is not used at all
        // ...
    };

See further in [R.30](#Rr-smartptrparam).

##### Note

We can catch dangling pointers statically, so we don't need to rely on resource management to avoid violations from dangling pointers.

**See also**: [when to prefer `T*` and when to prefer `T&`](#Rf-ptr-ref).

**See also**: Discussion of [smart pointer use](#Rr-summary-smartptrs).

##### Enforcement

Flag a parameter of a smart pointer type (a type that overloads `operator->` or `operator*`) for which the ownership semantics are not used;
that is

* copyable but never copied/moved from or movable but never moved
* and that is never modified or passed along to another function that could do so.

### <span id="Rf-pure"></span>F.8: Prefer pure functions

##### Reason

Pure functions are easier to reason about, sometimes easier to optimize (and even parallelize), and sometimes can be memoized.

##### Example

    template<class T>
    auto square(T t) { return t * t; }

##### Note

`constexpr` functions are pure.

When given a non-constant argument, a `constexpr` function can throw.
If you consider exiting by throwing a side-effect, a `constexpr` function isn't completely pure;
if not, this is not an issue.
??? A question for the committee: can a constructor for an exception thrown by a `constexpr` function modify state?
"No" would be a nice answer that matches most practice.

##### Enforcement

Not possible.

### <span id="Rf-unused"></span>F.9: Unused parameters should be unnamed

##### Reason

Readability.
Suppression of unused parameter warnings.

##### Example

    X* find(map<Blob>& m, const string& s, Hint);   // once upon a time, a hint was used

##### Note

Allowing parameters to be unnamed was introduced in the early 1980 to address this problem.

##### Enforcement

Flag named unused parameters.

## <span id="SS-call"></span>F.call: Parameter passing

There are a variety of ways to pass parameters to a function and to return values.

### <span id="Rf-conventional"></span>F.15: Prefer simple and conventional ways of passing information

##### Reason

Using "unusual and clever" techniques causes surprises, slows understanding by other programmers, and encourages bugs.
If you really feel the need for an optimization beyond the common techniques, measure to ensure that it really is an improvement, and document/comment because the improvement may not be portable.

The following tables summarize the advice in the following Guidelines, F.16-21.

Normal parameter passing:

![Normal parameter passing table](./param-passing-normal.png "Normal parameter passing")

Advanced parameter passing:

![Advanced parameter passing table](./param-passing-advanced.png "Advanced parameter passing")

Use the advanced techniques only after demonstrating need, and document that need in a comment.

### <span id="Rf-in"></span>F.16: For "in" parameters, pass cheaply-copied types by value and others by reference to `const`

##### Reason

Both let the caller know that a function will not modify the argument, and both allow initialization by rvalues.

What is "cheap to copy" depends on the machine architecture, but two or three words (doubles, pointers, references) are usually best passed by value.
When copying is cheap, nothing beats the simplicity and safety of copying, and for small objects (up to two or three words) it is also faster than passing by reference because it does not require an extra indirection to access from the function.

##### Example

    void f1(const string& s);  // OK: pass by reference to const; always cheap

    void f2(string s);         // bad: potentially expensive

    void f3(int x);            // OK: Unbeatable

    void f4(const int& x);     // bad: overhead on access in f4()

For advanced uses (only), where you really need to optimize for rvalues passed to "input-only" parameters:

* If the function is going to unconditionally move from the argument, take it by `&&`. See [F.18](#Rf-consume).
* If the function is going to keep a copy of the argument, in addition to passing by `const&` (for lvalues),
  add an overload that passes the parameter by `&&` (for rvalues) and in the body `std::move`s it to its destination. Essentially this overloads a "consume"; see [F.18](#Rf-consume).
* In special cases, such as multiple "input + copy" parameters, consider using perfect forwarding. See [F.19](#Rf-forward).

##### Example

    int multiply(int, int); // just input ints, pass by value

    // suffix is input-only but not as cheap as an int, pass by const&
    string& concatenate(string&, const string& suffix);

    void sink(unique_ptr<widget>);  // input only, and consumes the widget

Avoid "esoteric techniques" such as:

* Passing arguments as `T&&` "for efficiency".
  Most rumors about performance advantages from passing by `&&` are false or brittle (but see [F.25](#Rf-pass-ref-move).)
* Returning `const T&` from assignments and similar operations (see [F.47](#Rf-assignment-op).)

##### Example

Assuming that `Matrix` has move operations (possibly by keeping its elements in a `std::vector`):

    Matrix operator+(const Matrix& a, const Matrix& b)
    {
        Matrix res;
        // ... fill res with the sum ...
        return res;
    }

    Matrix x = m1 + m2;  // move constructor

    y = m3 + m3;         // move assignment

##### Notes

The return value optimization doesn't handle the assignment case, but the move assignment does.

A reference may be assumed to refer to a valid object (language rule).
There is no (legitimate) "null reference."
If you need the notion of an optional value, use a pointer, `std::optional`, or a special value used to denote "no value."

##### Enforcement

* (Simple) ((Foundation)) Warn when a parameter being passed by value has a size greater than `4 * sizeof(int)`.
  Suggest using a reference to `const` instead.
* (Simple) ((Foundation)) Warn when a `const` parameter being passed by reference has a size less than `3 * sizeof(int)`. Suggest passing by value instead.
* (Simple) ((Foundation)) Warn when a `const` parameter being passed by reference is `move`d.

### <span id="Rf-inout"></span>F.17: For "in-out" parameters, pass by reference to non-`const`

##### Reason

This makes it clear to callers that the object is assumed to be modified.

##### Example

    void update(Record& r);  // assume that update writes to r

##### Note

A `T&` argument can pass information into a function as well as well as out of it.
Thus `T&` could be an in-out-parameter. That can in itself be a problem and a source of errors:

    void f(string& s)
    {
        s = "New York";  // non-obvious error
    }

    void g()
    {
        string buffer = ".................................";
        f(buffer);
        // ...
    }

Here, the writer of `g()` is supplying a buffer for `f()` to fill, but `f()` simply replaces it (at a somewhat higher cost than a simple copy of the characters).
A bad logic error can happen if the writer of `g()` incorrectly assumes the size of the `buffer`.

##### Enforcement

* (Moderate) ((Foundation)) Warn about functions regarding reference to non-`const` parameters that do *not* write to them.
* (Simple) ((Foundation)) Warn when a non-`const` parameter being passed by reference is `move`d.

### <span id="Rf-consume"></span>F.18: For "consume" parameters, pass by `X&&` and `std::move` the parameter

##### Reason

It's efficient and eliminates bugs at the call site: `X&&` binds to rvalues, which requires an explicit `std::move` at the call site if passing an lvalue.

##### Example

    void sink(vector<int>&& v) {   // sink takes ownership of whatever the argument owned
        // usually there might be const accesses of v here
        store_somewhere(std::move(v));
        // usually no more use of v here; it is moved-from
    }

Note that the `std::move(v)` makes it possible for `store_somewhere()` to leave `v` in a moved-from state.
[That could be dangerous](#Rc-move-semantic).


##### Exception

Unique owner types that are move-only and cheap-to-move, such as `unique_ptr`, can also be passed by value which is simpler to write and achieves the same effect. Passing by value does generate one extra (cheap) move operation, but prefer simplicity and clarity first.

For example:

    template <class T>
    void sink(std::unique_ptr<T> p) {
        // use p ... possibly std::move(p) onward somewhere else
    }   // p gets destroyed

##### Enforcement

* Flag all `X&&` parameters (where `X` is not a template type parameter name) where the function body uses them without `std::move`.
* Flag access to moved-from objects.
* Don't conditionally move from objects

### <span id="Rf-forward"></span>F.19: For "forward" parameters, pass by `TP&&` and only `std::forward` the parameter

##### Reason

If the object is to be passed onward to other code and not directly used by this function, we want to make this function agnostic to the argument `const`-ness and rvalue-ness.

In that case, and only that case, make the parameter `TP&&` where `TP` is a template type parameter -- it both *ignores* and *preserves* `const`-ness and rvalue-ness. Therefore any code that uses a `TP&&` is implicitly declaring that it itself doesn't care about the variable's `const`-ness and rvalue-ness (because it is ignored), but that intends to pass the value onward to other code that does care about `const`-ness and rvalue-ness (because it is preserved). When used as a parameter `TP&&` is safe because any temporary objects passed from the caller will live for the duration of the function call. A parameter of type `TP&&` should essentially always be passed onward via `std::forward` in the body of the function.

##### Example

    template <class F, class... Args>
    inline auto invoke(F f, Args&&... args) {
        return f(forward<Args>(args)...);
    }

    ??? calls ???

##### Enforcement

* Flag a function that takes a `TP&&` parameter (where `TP` is a template type parameter name) and does anything with it other than `std::forward`ing it exactly once on every static path.

### <span id="Rf-out"></span>F.20: For "out" output values, prefer return values to output parameters

##### Reason

A return value is self-documenting, whereas a `&` could be either in-out or out-only and is liable to be misused.

This includes large objects like standard containers that use implicit move operations for performance and to avoid explicit memory management.

If you have multiple values to return, [use a tuple](#Rf-out-multi) or similar multi-member type.

##### Example

    // OK: return pointers to elements with the value x
    vector<const int*> find_all(const vector<int>&, int x);

    // Bad: place pointers to elements with value x in out
    void find_all(const vector<int>&, vector<const int*>& out, int x);

##### Note

A `struct` of many (individually cheap-to-move) elements may be in aggregate expensive to move.

It is not recommended to return a `const` value.
Such older advice is now obsolete; it does not add value, and it interferes with move semantics.

    const vector<int> fct();    // bad: that "const" is more trouble than it is worth

    vector<int> g(const vector<int>& vx)
    {
        // ...
        f() = vx;   // prevented by the "const"
        // ...
        return f(); // expensive copy: move semantics suppressed by the "const"
    }

The argument for adding `const` to a return value is that it prevents (very rare) accidental access to a temporary.
The argument against is prevents (very frequent) use of move semantics.

##### Exceptions

* For non-value types, such as types in an inheritance hierarchy, return the object by `unique_ptr` or `shared_ptr`.
* If a type is expensive to move (e.g., `array<BigPOD>`), consider allocating it on the free store and return a handle (e.g., `unique_ptr`), or passing it in a reference to non-`const` target object to fill (to be used as an out-parameter).
* To reuse an object that carries capacity (e.g., `std::string`, `std::vector`) across multiple calls to the function in an inner loop: [treat it as an in/out parameter and pass by reference](#Rf-out-multi).

##### Example

    struct Package {      // exceptional case: expensive-to-move object
        char header[16];
        char load[2024 - 16];
    };

    Package fill();       // Bad: large return value
    void fill(Package&);  // OK

    int val();            // OK
    void val(int&);       // Bad: Is val reading its argument

##### Enforcement

* Flag reference to non-`const` parameters that are not read before being written to and are a type that could be cheaply returned; they should be "out" return values.
* Flag returning a `const` value. To fix: Remove `const` to return a non-`const` value instead.

### <span id="Rf-out-multi"></span>F.21: To return multiple "out" values, prefer returning a tuple or struct

##### Reason

A return value is self-documenting as an "output-only" value.
Note that C++ does have multiple return values, by convention of using a `tuple`,
possibly with the extra convenience of `tie` at the call site.

##### Example

    // BAD: output-only parameter documented in a comment
    int f(const string& input, /*output only*/ string& output_data)
    {
        // ...
        output_data = something();
        return status;
    }

    // GOOD: self-documenting
    tuple<int, string> f(const string& input)
    {
        // ...
        return make_tuple(status, something());
    }

C++98's standard library already used this style, because a `pair` is like a two-element `tuple`.
For example, given a `set<string> my_set`, consider:

    // C++98
    result = my_set.insert("Hello");
    if (result.second) do_something_with(result.first);    // workaround

With C++11 we can write this, putting the results directly in existing local variables:

    Sometype iter;                                // default initialize if we haven't already
    Someothertype success;                        // used these variables for some other purpose

    tie(iter, success) = my_set.insert("Hello");   // normal return value
    if (success) do_something_with(iter);

With C++17 we should be able to use "structured bindings" to declare and initialize the multiple variables:

    if (auto [ iter, success ] = my_set.insert("Hello"); success) do_something_with(iter);

##### Exception

Sometimes, we need to pass an object to a function to manipulate its state.
In such cases, passing the object by reference [`T&`](#Rf-inout) is usually the right technique.
Explicitly passing an in-out parameter back out again as a return value is often not necessary.
For example:

    istream& operator>>(istream& is, string& s);    // much like std::operator>>()

    for (string s; cin >> s; ) {
        // do something with line
    }

Here, both `s` and `cin` are used as in-out parameters.
We pass `cin` by (non-`const`) reference to be able to manipulate its state.
We pass `s` to avoid repeated allocations.
By reusing `s` (passed by reference), we allocate new memory only when we need to expand `s`'s capacity.
This technique is sometimes called the "caller-allocated out" pattern and is particularly useful for types,
such as `string` and `vector`, that needs to do free store allocations.

To compare, if we passed out all values as return values, we would something like this:

    pair<istream&, string> get_string(istream& is);  // not recommended
    {
        string s;
        cin >> s;
        return {is, s};
    }

    for (auto p = get_string(cin); p.first; ) {
        // do something with p.second
    }

We consider that significantly less elegant with significantly less performance.

For a truly strict reading of this rule (F.21), the exception isn't really an exception because it relies on in-out parameters,
rather than the plain out parameters mentioned in the rule.
However, we prefer to be explicit, rather than subtle.

##### Note

In many cases, it may be useful to return a specific, user-defined type.
For example:

    struct Distance {
        int value;
        int unit = 1;   // 1 means meters
    };

    Distance d1 = measure(obj1);        // access d1.value and d1.unit
    auto d2 = measure(obj2);            // access d2.value and d2.unit
    auto [value, unit] = measure(obj3);   // access value and unit; somewhat redundant to people who know measure()
    auto [x,y] = measure(obj4);         // don't; it's likely to be confusing

The overly-generic `pair` and `tuple` should be used only when the value returned represents to independent entities rather than an abstraction.

Another example, use a specific type along the lines of `variant<T, error_code>`, rather than using the generic `tuple`.

##### Enforcement

* Output parameters should be replaced by return values.
  An output parameter is one that the function writes to, invokes a non-`const` member function, or passes on as a non-`const`.

### <span id="Rf-ptr"></span>F.22: Use `T*` or `owner<T*>` to designate a single object

##### Reason

Readability: it makes the meaning of a plain pointer clear.
Enables significant tool support.

##### Note

In traditional C and C++ code, plain `T*` is used for many weakly-related purposes, such as:

* Identify a (single) object (not to be deleted by this function)
* Point to an object allocated on the free store (and delete it later)
* Hold the `nullptr`
* Identify a C-style string (zero-terminated array of characters)
* Identify an array with a length specified separately
* Identify a location in an array

This makes it hard to understand what the code does and is supposed to do.
It complicates checking and tool support.

##### Example

    void use(int* p, int n, char* s, int* q)
    {
        p[n - 1] = 666; // Bad: we don't know if p points to n elements;
                        // assume it does not or use span<int>
        cout << s;      // Bad: we don't know if that s points to a zero-terminated array of char;
                        // assume it does not or use zstring
        delete q;       // Bad: we don't know if *q is allocated on the free store;
                        // assume it does not or use owner
    }

better

    void use2(span<int> p, zstring s, owner<int*> q)
    {
        p[p.size() - 1] = 666; // OK, a range error can be caught
        cout << s; // OK
        delete q;  // OK
    }

##### Note

`owner<T*>` represents ownership, `zstring` represents a C-style string.

**Also**: Assume that a `T*` obtained from a smart pointer to `T` (e.g., `unique_ptr<T>`) points to a single element.

**See also**: [Support library](#S-gsl).

##### Enforcement

* (Simple) ((Bounds)) Warn for any arithmetic operation on an expression of pointer type that results in a value of pointer type.

### <span id="Rf-nullptr"></span>F.23: Use a `not_null<T>` to indicate that "null" is not a valid value

##### Reason

Clarity. A function with a `not_null<T>` parameter makes it clear that the caller of the function is responsible for any `nullptr` checks that may be necessary.
Similarly, a function with a return value of `not_null<T>` makes it clear that the caller of the function does not need to check for `nullptr`.

##### Example

`not_null<T*>` makes it obvious to a reader (human or machine) that a test for `nullptr` is not necessary before dereference.
Additionally, when debugging, `owner<T*>` and `not_null<T>` can be instrumented to check for correctness.

Consider:

    int length(Record* p);

When I call `length(p)` should I test for `p == nullptr` first? Should the implementation of `length()` test for `p == nullptr`?

    // it is the caller's job to make sure p != nullptr
    int length(not_null<Record*> p);

    // the implementor of length() must assume that p == nullptr is possible
    int length(Record* p);

##### Note

A `not_null<T*>` is assumed not to be the `nullptr`; a `T*` may be the `nullptr`; both can be represented in memory as a `T*` (so no run-time overhead is implied).

##### Note

`not_null` is not just for built-in pointers. It works for `unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`, and other pointer-like types.

##### Enforcement

* (Simple) Warn if a raw pointer is dereferenced without being tested against `nullptr` (or equivalent) within a function, suggest it is declared `not_null` instead.
* (Simple) Error if a raw pointer is sometimes dereferenced after first being tested against `nullptr` (or equivalent) within the function and sometimes is not.
* (Simple) Warn if a `not_null` pointer is tested against `nullptr` within a function.

### <span id="Rf-range"></span>F.24: Use a `span<T>` or a `span_p<T>` to designate a half-open sequence

##### Reason

Informal/non-explicit ranges are a source of errors.

##### Example

    X* find(span<X> r, const X& v);    // find v in r

    vector<X> vec;
    // ...
    auto p = find({vec.begin(), vec.end()}, X{});  // find X{} in vec

##### Note

Ranges are extremely common in C++ code. Typically, they are implicit and their correct use is very hard to ensure.
In particular, given a pair of arguments `(p, n)` designating an array \[`p`:`p+n`),
it is in general impossible to know if there really are `n` elements to access following `*p`.
`span<T>` and `span_p<T>` are simple helper classes designating a \[`p`:`q`) range and a range starting with `p` and ending with the first element for which a predicate is true, respectively.

##### Example

A `span` represents a range of elements, but how do we manipulate elements of that range?

    void f(span<int> s)
    {
        // range traversal (guaranteed correct)
        for (int x : s) cout << x << '\n';

        // C-style traversal (potentially checked)
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) cout << s[i] << '\n';

        // random access (potentially checked)
        s[7] = 9;

        // extract pointers (potentially checked)
        std::sort(&s[0], &s[s.size() / 2]);
    }

##### Note

A `span<T>` object does not own its elements and is so small that it can be passed by value.

Passing a `span` object as an argument is exactly as efficient as passing a pair of pointer arguments or passing a pointer and an integer count.

**See also**: [Support library](#S-gsl).

##### Enforcement

(Complex) Warn where accesses to pointer parameters are bounded by other parameters that are integral types and suggest they could use `span` instead.

### <span id="Rf-string"></span>F.25: Use a `zstring` or a `not_null<zstring>` to designate a C-style string

##### Reason

C-style strings are ubiquitous. They are defined by convention: zero-terminated arrays of characters.
We must distinguish C-style strings from a pointer to a single character or an old-fashioned pointer to an array of characters.

##### Example

Consider:

    int length(const char* p);

When I call `length(s)` should I test for `s == nullptr` first? Should the implementation of `length()` test for `p == nullptr`?

    // the implementor of length() must assume that p == nullptr is possible
    int length(zstring p);

    // it is the caller's job to make sure p != nullptr
    int length(not_null<zstring> p);

##### Note

`zstring` do not represent ownership.

**See also**: [Support library](#S-gsl).

### <span id="Rf-unique_ptr"></span>F.26: Use a `unique_ptr<T>` to transfer ownership where a pointer is needed

##### Reason

Using `unique_ptr` is the cheapest way to pass a pointer safely.

See also [C.50](#Rc-factory) regarding when to return a `shared_ptr` from a factory.

##### Example

    unique_ptr<Shape> get_shape(istream& is)  // assemble shape from input stream
    {
        auto kind = read_header(is); // read header and identify the next shape on input
        switch (kind) {
        case kCircle:
            return make_unique<Circle>(is);
        case kTriangle:
            return make_unique<Triangle>(is);
        // ...
        }
    }

##### Note

You need to pass a pointer rather than an object if what you are transferring is an object from a class hierarchy that is to be used through an interface (base class).

##### Enforcement

(Simple) Warn if a function returns a locally-allocated raw pointer. Suggest using either `unique_ptr` or `shared_ptr` instead.

### <span id="Rf-shared_ptr"></span>F.27: Use a `shared_ptr<T>` to share ownership

##### Reason

Using `std::shared_ptr` is the standard way to represent shared ownership. That is, the last owner deletes the object.

##### Example

    shared_ptr<const Image> im { read_image(somewhere) };

    std::thread t0 {shade, args0, top_left, im};
    std::thread t1 {shade, args1, top_right, im};
    std::thread t2 {shade, args2, bottom_left, im};
    std::thread t3 {shade, args3, bottom_right, im};

    // detach threads
    // last thread to finish deletes the image

##### Note

Prefer a `unique_ptr` over a `shared_ptr` if there is never more than one owner at a time.
`shared_ptr` is for shared ownership.

Note that pervasive use of `shared_ptr` has a cost (atomic operations on the `shared_ptr`'s reference count have a measurable aggregate cost).

##### Alternative

Have a single object own the shared object (e.g. a scoped object) and destroy that (preferably implicitly) when all users have completed.

##### Enforcement

(Not enforceable) This is a too complex pattern to reliably detect.

### <span id="Rf-ptr-ref"></span>F.60: Prefer `T*` over `T&` when "no argument" is a valid option

##### Reason

A pointer (`T*`) can be a `nullptr` and a reference (`T&`) cannot, there is no valid "null reference".
Sometimes having `nullptr` as an alternative to indicated "no object" is useful, but if it is not, a reference is notationally simpler and might yield better code.

##### Example

    string zstring_to_string(zstring p) // zstring is a char*; that is a C-style string
    {
        if (p == nullptr) return string{};    // p might be nullptr; remember to check
        return string{p};
    }

    void print(const vector<int>& r)
    {
        // r refers to a vector<int>; no check needed
    }

##### Note

It is possible, but not valid C++ to construct a reference that is essentially a `nullptr` (e.g., `T* p = nullptr; T& r = (T&)*p;`).
That error is very uncommon.

##### Note

If you prefer the pointer notation (`->` and/or `*` vs. `.`), `not_null<T*>` provides the same guarantee as `T&`.

##### Enforcement

* Flag ???

### <span id="Rf-return-ptr"></span>F.42: Return a `T*` to indicate a position (only)

##### Reason

That's what pointers are good for.
Returning a `T*` to transfer ownership is a misuse.

##### Example

    Node* find(Node* t, const string& s)  // find s in a binary tree of Nodes
    {
        if (t == nullptr || t->name == s) return t;
        if ((auto p = find(t->left, s))) return p;
        if ((auto p = find(t->right, s))) return p;
        return nullptr;
    }

If it isn't the `nullptr`, the pointer returned by `find` indicates a `Node` holding `s`.
Importantly, that does not imply a transfer of ownership of the pointed-to object to the caller.

##### Note

Positions can also be transferred by iterators, indices, and references.
A reference is often a superior alternative to a pointer [if there is no need to use `nullptr`](#Rf-ptr-ref) or [if the object referred to should not change](???).

##### Note

Do not return a pointer to something that is not in the caller's scope; see [F.43](#Rf-dangle).

**See also**: [discussion of dangling pointer prevention](#???).

##### Enforcement

* Flag `delete`, `std::free()`, etc. applied to a plain `T*`.
Only owners should be deleted.
* Flag `new`, `malloc()`, etc. assigned to a plain `T*`.
Only owners should be responsible for deletion.

### <span id="Rf-dangle"></span>F.43: Never (directly or indirectly) return a pointer or a reference to a local object

##### Reason

To avoid the crashes and data corruption that can result from the use of such a dangling pointer.

##### Example, bad

After the return from a function its local objects no longer exist:

    int* f()
    {
        int fx = 9;
        return &fx;  // BAD
    }

    void g(int* p)   // looks innocent enough
    {
        int gx;
        cout << "*p == " << *p << '\n';
        *p = 999;
        cout << "gx == " << gx << '\n';
    }

    void h()
    {
        int* p = f();
        int z = *p;  // read from abandoned stack frame (bad)
        g(p);        // pass pointer to abandoned stack frame to function (bad)
    }

Here on one popular implementation I got the output:

    *p == 999
    gx == 999

I expected that because the call of `g()` reuses the stack space abandoned by the call of `f()` so `*p` refers to the space now occupied by `gx`.

* Imagine what would happen if `fx` and `gx` were of different types.
* Imagine what would happen if `fx` or `gx` was a type with an invariant.
* Imagine what would happen if more that dangling pointer was passed around among a larger set of functions.
* Imagine what a cracker could do with that dangling pointer.

Fortunately, most (all?) modern compilers catch and warn against this simple case.

##### Note

This applies to references as well:

    int& f()
    {
        int x = 7;
        // ...
        return x;  // Bad: returns reference to object that is about to be destroyed
    }

##### Note

This applies only to non-`static` local variables.
All `static` variables are (as their name indicates) statically allocated, so that pointers to them cannot dangle.

##### Example, bad

Not all examples of leaking a pointer to a local variable are that obvious:

    int* glob;       // global variables are bad in so many ways

    template<class T>
    void steal(T x)
    {
        glob = x();  // BAD
    }

    void f()
    {
        int i = 99;
        steal([&] { return &i; });
    }

    int main()
    {
        f();
        cout << *glob << '\n';
    }

Here I managed to read the location abandoned by the call of `f`.
The pointer stored in `glob` could be used much later and cause trouble in unpredictable ways.

##### Note

The address of a local variable can be "returned"/leaked by a return statement, by a `T&` out-parameter, as a member of a returned object, as an element of a returned array, and more.

##### Note

Similar examples can be constructed "leaking" a pointer from an inner scope to an outer one;
such examples are handled equivalently to leaks of pointers out of a function.

A slightly different variant of the problem is placing pointers in a container that outlives the objects pointed to.

**See also**: Another way of getting dangling pointers is [pointer invalidation](#???).
It can be detected/prevented with similar techniques.

##### Enforcement

* Compilers tend to catch return of reference to locals and could in many cases catch return of pointers to locals.
* Static analysis can catch many common patterns of the use of pointers indicating positions (thus eliminating dangling pointers)

### <span id="Rf-return-ref"></span>F.44: Return a `T&` when copy is undesirable and "returning no object" isn't needed

##### Reason

The language guarantees that a `T&` refers to an object, so that testing for `nullptr` isn't necessary.

**See also**: The return of a reference must not imply transfer of ownership:
[discussion of dangling pointer prevention](#???) and [discussion of ownership](#???).

##### Example

    class Car
    {
        array<wheel, 4> w;
        // ...
    public:
        wheel& get_wheel(size_t i) { Expects(i < 4); return w[i]; }
        // ...
    };

    void use()
    {
        Car c;
        wheel& w0 = c.get_wheel(0); // w0 has the same lifetime as c
    }

##### Enforcement

Flag functions where no `return` expression could yield `nullptr`

### <span id="Rf-return-ref-ref"></span>F.45: Don't return a `T&&`

##### Reason

It's asking to return a reference to a destroyed temporary object. A `&&` is a magnet for temporary objects. This is fine when the reference to the temporary is being passed "downward" to a callee, because the temporary is guaranteed to outlive the function call. (See [F.24](#Rf-pass-ref-ref) and [F.25](#Rf-pass-ref-move).) However, it's not fine when passing such a reference "upward" to a larger caller scope. See also ???.

For passthrough functions that pass in parameters (by ordinary reference or by perfect forwarding) and want to return values, use simple `auto` return type deduction (not `auto&&`).

##### Example, bad

If `F` returns by value, this function returns a reference to a temporary.

    template<class F>
    auto&& wrapper(F f)
    {
        log_call(typeid(f)); // or whatever instrumentation
        return f();
    }

##### Example, good

Better:

    template<class F>
    auto wrapper(F f)
    {
        log_call(typeid(f)); // or whatever instrumentation
        return f();
    }

##### Exception

`std::move` and `std::forward` do return `&&`, but they are just casts -- used by convention only in expression contexts where a reference to a temporary object is passed along within the same expression before the temporary is destroyed. We don't know of any other good examples of returning `&&`.

##### Enforcement

Flag any use of `&&` as a return type, except in `std::move` and `std::forward`.

### <span id="Rf-main"></span>F.46: `int` is the return type for `main()`

##### Reason

It's a language rule, but violated through "language extensions" so often that it is worth mentioning.
Declaring `main` (the one global `main` of a program) `void` limits portability.

##### Example

        void main() { /* ... */ };  // bad, not C++

        int main()
        {
            std::cout << "This is the way to do it\n";
        }

##### Note

We mention this only because of the persistence of this error in the community.

##### Enforcement

* The compiler should do it
* If the compiler doesn't do it, let tools flag it

### <span id="Rf-assignment-op"></span>F.47: Return `T&` from assignment operators

##### Reason

The convention for operator overloads (especially on value types) is for
`operator=(const T&)` to perform the assignment and then return (non-const)
`*this`.  This ensures consistency with standard library types and follows the
principle of "do as the ints do."

##### Note

Historically there was some guidance to make the assignment operator return `const T&`.
This was primarily to avoid code of the form `(a = b) = c` -- such code is not common enough to warrant violating consistency with standard types.

##### Example

    class Foo
    {
     public:
        ...
        Foo& operator=(const Foo& rhs) {
          // Copy members.
          ...
          return *this;
        }
    };

##### Enforcement

This should be enforced by tooling by checking the return type (and return
value) of any assignment operator.

### <span id="Rf-capture-vs-overload"></span>F.50: Use a lambda when a function won't do (to capture local variables, or to write a local function)

##### Reason

Functions can't capture local variables or be declared at local scope; if you need those things, prefer a lambda where possible, and a handwritten function object where not. On the other hand, lambdas and function objects don't overload; if you need to overload, prefer a function (the workarounds to make lambdas overload are ornate). If either will work, prefer writing a function; use the simplest tool necessary.

##### Example

    // writing a function that should only take an int or a string
    // -- overloading is natural
    void f(int);
    void f(const string&);

    // writing a function object that needs to capture local state and appear
    // at statement or expression scope -- a lambda is natural
    vector<work> v = lots_of_work();
    for (int tasknum = 0; tasknum < max; ++tasknum) {
        pool.run([=, &v]{
            /*
            ...
            ... process 1 / max - th of v, the tasknum - th chunk
            ...
            */
        });
    }
    pool.join();

##### Exception

Generic lambdas offer a concise way to write function templates and so can be useful even when a normal function template would do equally well with a little more syntax. This advantage will probably disappear in the future once all functions gain the ability to have Concept parameters.

##### Enforcement

* Warn on use of a named non-generic lambda (e.g., `auto x = [](int i){ /*...*/; };`) that captures nothing and appears at global scope. Write an ordinary function instead.

### <span id="Rf-default-args"></span>F.51: Where there is a choice, prefer default arguments over overloading

##### Reason

Default arguments simply provides alternative interfaces to a single implementation.
There is no guarantee that a set of overloaded functions all implement the same semantics.
The use of default arguments can avoid code replication.

##### Note

There is a choice between using default argument and overloading when the alternatives are from a set of arguments of the same types.
For example:

    void print(const string& s, format f = {});

as opposed to

    void print(const string& s);  // use default format
    void print(const string& s, format f);

There is not a choice when a set of functions are used to do a semantically equivalent operation to a set of types. For example:

    void print(const char&);
    void print(int);
    void print(zstring);

### <span id="Rf-reference-capture"></span>F.52: Prefer capturing by reference in lambdas that will be used locally, including passed to algorithms

##### Reason

For efficiency and correctness, you nearly always want to capture by reference when using the lambda locally. This includes when writing or calling parallel algorithms that are local because they join before returning.

##### Example

This is a simple three-stage parallel pipeline. Each `stage` object encapsulates a worker thread and a queue, has a `process` function to enqueue work, and in its destructor automatically blocks waiting for the queue to empty before ending the thread.

    void send_packets(buffers& bufs)
    {
        stage encryptor([] (buffer& b){ encrypt(b); });
        stage compressor([&](buffer& b){ compress(b); encryptor.process(b); });
        stage decorator([&](buffer& b){ decorate(b); compressor.process(b); });
        for (auto& b : bufs) { decorator.process(b); }
    }  // automatically blocks waiting for pipeline to finish

##### Enforcement

### <span id="Rf-value-capture"></span>F.53: Avoid capturing by reference in lambdas that will be used nonlocally, including returned, stored on the heap, or passed to another thread

##### Reason

Pointers and references to locals shouldn't outlive their scope. Lambdas that capture by reference are just another place to store a reference to a local object, and shouldn't do so if they (or a copy) outlive the scope.

##### Example, bad

    int local = 42;

    // Want a reference to local.
    // Note, that after program exits this scope,
    // local no longer exists, therefore
    // process() call will have undefined behavior!
    thread_pool.queue_work([&]{ process(local); });

##### Example, good

    int local = 42;
    // Want a copy of local.
    // Since a copy of local is made, it will
    // always be available for the call.
    thread_pool.queue_work([=]{ process(local); });

##### Enforcement

* (Simple) Warn when capture-list contains a reference to a locally declared variable
* (Complex) Flag when capture-list contains a reference to a locally declared variable and the lambda is passed to a non-`const` and non-local context

### <span id="Rf-this-capture"></span>F.54: If you capture `this`, capture all variables explicitly (no default capture)

##### Reason

It's confusing. Writing `[=]` in a member function appears to capture by value, but actually captures data members by reference because it actually captures the invisible `this` pointer by value. If you meant to do that, write `this` explicitly.

##### Example

    class My_class {
        int x = 0;
        // ...

        void f() {
            int i = 0;
            // ...

            auto lambda = [=]{ use(i, x); };   // BAD: "looks like" copy/value capture
            // [&] has identical semantics and copies the this pointer under the current rules
            // [=,this] and [&,this] are not much better, and confusing

            x = 42;
            lambda(); // calls use(42);
            x = 43;
            lambda(); // calls use(43);

            // ...

            auto lambda2 = [i, this]{ use(i, x); }; // ok, most explicit and least confusing

            // ...
        }
    };

##### Note

This is under active discussion in standardization, and may be addressed in a future version of the standard by adding a new capture mode or possibly adjusting the meaning of `[=]`. For now, just be explicit.

##### Enforcement

* Flag any lambda capture-list that specifies a default capture and also captures `this` (whether explicitly or via default capture)
