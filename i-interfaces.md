# <a name="S-interfaces"></a>I: Interfaces

An interface is a contract between two parts of a program. Precisely stating what is expected of a supplier of a service and a user of that service is essential.
Having good (easy-to-understand, encouraging efficient use, not error-prone, supporting testing, etc.) interfaces is probably the most important single aspect of code organization.

### <a name="Ri-explicit"></a>I.1: Make interfaces explicit

##### Reason

Correctness. Assumptions not stated in an interface are easily overlooked and hard to test.

##### Example, bad

Controlling the behavior of a function through a global (namespace scope) variable (a call mode) is implicit and potentially confusing. For example:

    int rnd(double d)
    {
        return (rnd_up) ? ceil(d) : d;    // don't: "invisible" dependency
    }

It will not be obvious to a caller that the meaning of two calls of `rnd(7.2)` might give different results.

##### Exception

Sometimes we control the details of a set of operations by an environment variable, e.g., normal vs. verbose output or debug vs. optimized.
The use of a non-local control is potentially confusing, but controls only implementation details of otherwise fixed semantics.

##### Example, bad

Reporting through non-local variables (e.g., `errno`) is easily ignored. For example:

    // don't: no test of printf's return value
    fprintf(connection, "logging: %d %d %d\n", x, y, s);

What if the connection goes down so that no logging output is produced? See I.??.

**Alternative**: Throw an exception. An exception cannot be ignored.

**Alternative formulation**: Avoid passing information across an interface through non-local or implicit state.
Note that non-`const` member functions pass information to other member functions through their object's state.

**Alternative formulation**: An interface should be a function or a set of functions.
Functions can be template functions and sets of functions can be classes or class templates.

##### Enforcement

* (Simple) A function should not make control-flow decisions based on the values of variables declared at namespace scope.
* (Simple) A function should not write to variables declared at namespace scope.

### <a name="Ri-global"></a>I.2 Avoid global variables

##### Reason

Non-`const` global variables hide dependencies and make the dependencies subject to unpredictable changes.

##### Example

    struct Data {
        // ... lots of stuff ...
    } data;            // non-const data

    void compute()     // don't
    {
        // ... use data ...
    }

    void output()     // don't
    {
        // ... use data ...
    }

Who else might modify `data`?

##### Note

Global constants are useful.

##### Note

The rule against global variables applies to namespace scope variables as well.

**Alternative**: If you use global (more generally namespace scope) data to avoid copying, consider passing the data as an object by reference to `const`.
Another solution is to define the data as the state of some object and the operations as member functions.

**Warning**: Beware of data races: If one thread can access nonlocal data (or data passed by reference) while another thread executes the callee, we can have a data race.
Every pointer or reference to mutable data is a potential data race.

##### Note

You cannot have a race condition on immutable data.

**References**: See the [rules for calling functions](#SS-call).

##### Enforcement

(Simple) Report all non-`const` variables declared at namespace scope.

### <a name="Ri-singleton"></a>I.3: Avoid singletons

##### Reason

Singletons are basically complicated global objects in disguise.

##### Example

    class Singleton {
        // ... lots of stuff to ensure that only one Singleton object is created,
        // that it is initialized properly, etc.
    };

There are many variants of the singleton idea.
That's part of the problem.

##### Note

If you don't want a global object to change, declare it `const` or `constexpr`.

##### Exception

You can use the simplest "singleton" (so simple that it is often not considered a singleton) to get initialization on first use, if any:

    X& myX()
    {
        static X my_x {3};
        return my_x;
    }

This is one of the most effective solutions to problems related to initialization order.
In a multi-threaded environment, the initialization of the static object does not introduce a race condition
(unless you carelessly access a shared object from within its constructor).

Note that the initialization of a local `static` does not imply a race condition.
However, if the destruction of `X` involves an operation that needs to be synchronized we must use a less simple solution.
For example:

    X& myX()
    {
        static auto p = new X {3};
        return *p;  // potential leak
    }

Now someone must `delete` that object in some suitably thread-safe way.
That's error-prone, so we don't use that technique unless

* `myX` is in multithreaded code,
* that `X` object needs to be destroyed (e.g., because it releases a resource), and
* `X`'s destructor's code needs to be synchronized.

If you, as many do, define a singleton as a class for which only one object is created, functions like `myX` are not singletons, and this useful technique is not an exception to the no-singleton rule.

##### Enforcement

Very hard in general.

* Look for classes with names that include `singleton`.
* Look for classes for which only a single object is created (by counting objects or by examining constructors).
* If a class X has a public static function that contains a function-local static of the class' type X and returns a pointer or reference to it, ban that.

### <a name="Ri-typed"></a>I.4: Make interfaces precisely and strongly typed

##### Reason

Types are the simplest and best documentation, have well-defined meaning, and are guaranteed to be checked at compile time.
Also, precisely typed code is often optimized better.

##### Example, don't

Consider:

    void pass(void* data);    // void* is suspicious

Now the callee must cast the data pointer (back) to a correct type to use it. That is error-prone and often verbose.
Avoid `void*`, especially in interfaces.
Consider using a `variant` or a pointer to base instead.

**Alternative**: Often, a template parameter can eliminate the `void*` turning it into a `T*` or `T&`.
For generic code these `T`s can be general or concept constrained template parameters.

##### Example, bad

Consider:

    void draw_rect(int, int, int, int);   // great opportunities for mistakes

    draw_rect(p.x, p.y, 10, 20);          // what does 10, 20 mean?

An `int` can carry arbitrary forms of information, so we must guess about the meaning of the four `int`s.
Most likely, the first two are an `x`,`y` coordinate pair, but what are the last two?
Comments and parameter names can help, but we could be explicit:

    void draw_rectangle(Point top_left, Point bottom_right);
    void draw_rectangle(Point top_left, Size height_width);

    draw_rectangle(p, Point{10, 20});  // two corners
    draw_rectangle(p, Size{10, 20});   // one corner and a (height, width) pair

Obviously, we cannot catch all errors through the static type system
(e.g., the fact that a first argument is supposed to be a top-left point is left to convention (naming and comments)).

##### Example, bad

In the following example, it is not clear from the interface what `time_to_blink` means: Seconds? Milliseconds?

    void blink_led(int time_to_blink) // bad -- the unit is ambiguous
    {
        // ...
        // do something with time_to_blink
        // ...
    }

    void use()
    {
        blink_led(2);
    }

##### Example, good

`std::chrono::duration` types (C++11) helps making the unit of time duration explicit.

    void blink_led(milliseconds time_to_blink) // good -- the unit is explicit
    {
        // ...
        // do something with time_to_blink
        // ...
    }

    void use()
    {
        blink_led(1500ms);
    }

The function can also be written in such a way that it will accept any time duration unit.

    template<class rep, class period>
    void blink_led(duration<rep, period> time_to_blink) // good -- accepts any unit
    {
        // assuming that millisecond is the smallest relevant unit
        auto milliseconds_to_blink = duration_cast<milliseconds>(time_to_blink);
        // ...
        // do something with milliseconds_to_blink
        // ...
    }

    void use()
    {
        blink_led(2s);
        blink_led(1500ms);
    }

##### Enforcement

* (Simple) Report the use of `void*` as a parameter or return type.
* (Hard to do well) Look for member functions with many built-in type arguments.

### <a name="Ri-pre"></a>I.5: State preconditions (if any)

##### Reason

Arguments have meaning that may constrain their proper use in the callee.

##### Example

Consider:

    double sqrt(double x);

Here `x` must be nonnegative. The type system cannot (easily and naturally) express that, so we must use other means. For example:

    double sqrt(double x); // x must be nonnegative

Some preconditions can be expressed as assertions. For example:

    double sqrt(double x) { Expects(x >= 0); /* ... */ }

Ideally, that `Expects(x >= 0)` should be part of the interface of `sqrt()` but that's not easily done. For now, we place it in the definition (function body).

**References**: `Expects()` is described in [GSL](#S-gsl).

##### Note

Prefer a formal specification of requirements, such as `Expects(p != nullptr);`.
If that is infeasible, use English text in comments, such as `// the sequence [p:q) is ordered using <`.

##### Note

Most member functions have as a precondition that some class invariant holds.
That invariant is established by a constructor and must be reestablished upon exit by every member function called from outside the class.
We don't need to mention it for each member function.

##### Enforcement

(Not enforceable)

**See also**: The rules for passing pointers. ???

### <a name="Ri-expects"></a>I.6: Prefer `Expects()` for expressing preconditions

##### Reason

To make it clear that the condition is a precondition and to enable tool use.

##### Example

    int area(int height, int width)
    {
        Expects(height > 0 && width > 0);            // good
        if (height <= 0 || width <= 0) my_error();   // obscure
        // ...
    }

##### Note

Preconditions can be stated in many ways, including comments, `if`-statements, and `assert()`.
This can make them hard to distinguish from ordinary code, hard to update, hard to manipulate by tools, and may have the wrong semantics (do you always want to abort in debug mode and check nothing in productions runs?).

##### Note

Preconditions should be part of the interface rather than part of the implementation,
but we don't yet have the language facilities to do that.
Once language support becomes available (e.g., see the [contract proposal](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0380r1.pdf)) we will adopt the standard version of preconditions, postconditions, and assertions.

##### Note

`Expects()` can also be used to check a condition in the middle of an algorithm.

##### Enforcement

(Not enforceable) Finding the variety of ways preconditions can be asserted is not feasible. Warning about those that can be easily identified (`assert()`) has questionable value in the absence of a language facility.

### <a name="Ri-post"></a>I.7: State postconditions

##### Reason

To detect misunderstandings about the result and possibly catch erroneous implementations.

##### Example, bad

Consider:

    int area(int height, int width) { return height * width; }  // bad

Here, we (incautiously) left out the precondition specification, so it is not explicit that height and width must be positive.
We also left out the postcondition specification, so it is not obvious that the algorithm (`height * width`) is wrong for areas larger than the largest integer.
Overflow can happen.
Consider using:

    int area(int height, int width)
    {
        auto res = height * width;
        Ensures(res > 0);
        return res;
    }

##### Example, bad

Consider a famous security bug:

    void f()    // problematic
    {
        char buffer[MAX];
        // ...
        memset(buffer, 0, MAX);
    }

There was no postcondition stating that the buffer should be cleared and the optimizer eliminated the apparently redundant `memset()` call:

    void f()    // better
    {
        char buffer[MAX];
        // ...
        memset(buffer, 0, MAX);
        Ensures(buffer[0] == 0);
    }

##### Note

Postconditions are often informally stated in a comment that states the purpose of a function; `Ensures()` can be used to make this more systematic, visible, and checkable.

##### Note

Postconditions are especially important when they relate to something that is not directly reflected in a returned result, such as a state of a data structure used.

##### Example

Consider a function that manipulates a `Record`, using a `mutex` to avoid race conditions:

    mutex m;

    void manipulate(Record& r)    // don't
    {
        m.lock();
        // ... no m.unlock() ...
    }

Here, we "forgot" to state that the `mutex` should be released, so we don't know if the failure to ensure release of the `mutex` was a bug or a feature.
Stating the postcondition would have made it clear:

    void manipulate(Record& r)    // postcondition: m is unlocked upon exit
    {
        m.lock();
        // ... no m.unlock() ...
    }

The bug is now obvious (but only to a human reading comments).

Better still, use [RAII](#Rr-raii) to ensure that the postcondition ("the lock must be released") is enforced in code:

    void manipulate(Record& r)    // best
    {
        lock_guard<mutex> _ {m};
        // ...
    }

##### Note

Ideally, postconditions are stated in the interface/declaration so that users can easily see them.
Only postconditions related to the users can be stated in the interface.
Postconditions related only to internal state belongs in the definition/implementation.

##### Enforcement

(Not enforceable) This is a philosophical guideline that is infeasible to check
directly in the general case. Domain specific checkers (like lock-holding
checkers) exist for many toolchains.

### <a name="Ri-ensures"></a>I.8: Prefer `Ensures()` for expressing postconditions

##### Reason

To make it clear that the condition is a postcondition and to enable tool use.

##### Example

    void f()
    {
        char buffer[MAX];
        // ...
        memset(buffer, 0, MAX);
        Ensures(buffer[0] == 0);
    }

##### Note

Postconditions can be stated in many ways, including comments, `if`-statements, and `assert()`.
This can make them hard to distinguish from ordinary code, hard to update, hard to manipulate by tools, and may have the wrong semantics.

**Alternative**: Postconditions of the form "this resource must be released" are best expressed by [RAII](#Rr-raii).

##### Note

Ideally, that `Ensures` should be part of the interface, but that's not easily done.
For now, we place it in the definition (function body).
Once language support becomes available (e.g., see the [contract proposal](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0380r1.pdf)) we will adopt the standard version of preconditions, postconditions, and assertions.

##### Enforcement

(Not enforceable) Finding the variety of ways postconditions can be asserted is not feasible. Warning about those that can be easily identified (`assert()`) has questionable value in the absence of a language facility.

### <a name="Ri-concepts"></a>I.9: If an interface is a template, document its parameters using concepts

##### Reason

Make the interface precisely specified and compile-time checkable in the (not so distant) future.

##### Example

Use the ISO Concepts TS style of requirements specification. For example:

    template<typename Iter, typename Val>
    // requires InputIterator<Iter> && EqualityComparable<ValueType<Iter>>, Val>
    Iter find(Iter first, Iter last, Val v)
    {
        // ...
    }

##### Note

Soon (maybe in 2017), most compilers will be able to check `requires` clauses once the `//` is removed.
For now, the concept TS is supported only in GCC 6.1.

**See also**: [Generic programming](#SS-GP) and [concepts](#SS-t-concepts).

##### Enforcement

(Not yet enforceable) A language facility is under specification. When the language facility is available, warn if any non-variadic template parameter is not constrained by a concept (in its declaration or mentioned in a `requires` clause).

### <a name="Ri-except"></a>I.10: Use exceptions to signal a failure to perform a required task

##### Reason

It should not be possible to ignore an error because that could leave the system or a computation in an undefined (or unexpected) state.
This is a major source of errors.

##### Example

    int printf(const char* ...);    // bad: return negative number if output fails

    template <class F, class ...Args>
    // good: throw system_error if unable to start the new thread
    explicit thread(F&& f, Args&&... args);

##### Note

What is an error?

An error means that the function cannot achieve its advertised purpose (including establishing postconditions).
Calling code that ignores an error could lead to wrong results or undefined systems state.
For example, not being able to connect to a remote server is not by itself an error:
the server can refuse a connection for all kinds of reasons, so the natural thing is to return a result that the caller should always check.
However, if failing to make a connection is considered an error, then a failure should throw an exception.

##### Exception

Many traditional interface functions (e.g., UNIX signal handlers) use error codes (e.g., `errno`) to report what are really status codes, rather than errors. You don't have a good alternative to using such, so calling these does not violate the rule.

##### Alternative

If you can't use exceptions (e.g. because your code is full of old-style raw-pointer use or because there are hard-real-time constraints), consider using a style that returns a pair of values:

    int val;
    int error_code;
    tie(val, error_code) = do_something();
    if (error_code == 0) {
        // ... handle the error or exit ...
    }
    // ... use val ...

This style unfortunately leads to uninitialized variables.
A facility [structured bindings](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0144r1.pdf) to deal with that will become available in C++17.

    [val, error_code] = do_something();
    if (error_code == 0) {
        // ... handle the error or exit ...
    }
    // ... use val ...

##### Note

We don't consider "performance" a valid reason not to use exceptions.

* Often, explicit error checking and handling consume as much time and space as exception handling.
* Often, cleaner code yields better performance with exceptions (simplifying the tracing of paths through the program and their optimization).
* A good rule for performance critical code is to move checking outside the critical part of the code ([checking](#Rper-checking)).
* In the longer term, more regular code gets better optimized.
* Always carefully [measure](#Rper-measure) before making performance claims.

**See also**: [I.5](#Ri-pre) and [I.7](#Ri-post) for reporting precondition and postcondition violations.

##### Enforcement

* (Not enforceable) This is a philosophical guideline that is infeasible to check directly.
* Look for `errno`.

### <a name="Ri-raw"></a>I.11: Never transfer ownership by a raw pointer (`T*`)

##### Reason

If there is any doubt whether the caller or the callee owns an object, leaks or premature destruction will occur.

##### Example

Consider:

    X* compute(args)    // don't
    {
        X* res = new X{};
        // ...
        return res;
    }

Who deletes the returned `X`? The problem would be harder to spot if compute returned a reference.
Consider returning the result by value (use move semantics if the result is large):

    vector<double> compute(args)  // good
    {
        vector<double> res(10000);
        // ...
        return res;
    }

**Alternative**: Pass ownership using a "smart pointer", such as `unique_ptr` (for exclusive ownership) and `shared_ptr` (for shared ownership).
However, that is less elegant and less efficient unless reference semantics are needed.

**Alternative**: Sometimes older code can't be modified because of ABI compatibility requirements or lack of resources.
In that case, mark owning pointers using `owner` from the [guideline support library](#S-gsl):

    owner<X*> compute(args)    // It is now clear that ownership is transferred
    {
        owner<X*> res = new X{};
        // ...
        return res;
    }

This tells analysis tools that `res` is an owner.
That is, its value must be `delete`d or transferred to another owner, as is done here by the `return`.

`owner` is used similarly in the implementation of resource handles.

##### Note

Every object passed as a raw pointer (or iterator) is assumed to be owned by the
caller, so that its lifetime is handled by the caller. Viewed another way:
ownership transferring APIs are relatively rare compared to pointer-passing APIs,
so the default is "no ownership transfer."

**See also**: [Argument passing](#Rf-conventional) and [value return](#Rf-T-return).

##### Enforcement

* (Simple) Warn on `delete` of a raw pointer that is not an `owner`.
* (Simple) Warn on failure to either `reset` or explicitly `delete` an `owner` pointer on every code path.
* (Simple) Warn if the return value of `new` or a function call with an `owner` return value is assigned to a raw pointer or non-`owner` reference.

### <a name="Ri-nullptr"></a>I.12: Declare a pointer that must not be null as `not_null`

##### Reason

To help avoid dereferencing `nullptr` errors.
To improve performance by avoiding redundant checks for `nullptr`.

##### Example

    int length(const char* p);            // it is not clear whether length(nullptr) is valid

    length(nullptr);                      // OK?

    int length(not_null<const char*> p);  // better: we can assume that p cannot be nullptr

    int length(const char* p);            // we must assume that p can be nullptr

By stating the intent in source, implementers and tools can provide better diagnostics, such as finding some classes of errors through static analysis, and perform optimizations, such as removing branches and null tests.

##### Note

`not_null` is defined in the [guideline support library](#S-gsl).

##### Note

The assumption that the pointer to `char` pointed to a C-style string (a zero-terminated string of characters) was still implicit, and a potential source of confusion and errors. Use `czstring` in preference to `const char*`.

    // we can assume that p cannot be nullptr
    // we can assume that p points to a zero-terminated array of characters
    int length(not_null<zstring> p);

Note: `length()` is, of course, `std::strlen()` in disguise.

##### Enforcement

* (Simple) ((Foundation)) If a function checks a pointer parameter against `nullptr` before access, on all control-flow paths, then warn it should be declared `not_null`.
* (Complex) If a function with pointer return value ensures it is not `nullptr` on all return paths, then warn the return type should be declared `not_null`.

### <a name="Ri-array"></a>I.13: Do not pass an array as a single pointer

##### Reason

 (pointer, size)-style interfaces are error-prone. Also, a plain pointer (to array) must rely on some convention to allow the callee to determine the size.

##### Example

Consider:

    void copy_n(const T* p, T* q, int n); // copy from [p:p+n) to [q:q+n)

What if there are fewer than `n` elements in the array pointed to by `q`? Then, we overwrite some probably unrelated memory.
What if there are fewer than `n` elements in the array pointed to by `p`? Then, we read some probably unrelated memory.
Either is undefined behavior and a potentially very nasty bug.

##### Alternative

Consider using explicit spans:

    void copy(span<const T> r, span<T> r2); // copy r to r2

##### Example, bad

Consider:

    void draw(Shape* p, int n);  // poor interface; poor code
    Circle arr[10];
    // ...
    draw(arr, 10);

Passing `10` as the `n` argument may be a mistake: the most common convention is to assume \[`0`:`n`) but that is nowhere stated. Worse is that the call of `draw()` compiled at all: there was an implicit conversion from array to pointer (array decay) and then another implicit conversion from `Circle` to `Shape`. There is no way that `draw()` can safely iterate through that array: it has no way of knowing the size of the elements.

**Alternative**: Use a support class that ensures that the number of elements is correct and prevents dangerous implicit conversions. For example:

    void draw2(span<Circle>);
    Circle arr[10];
    // ...
    draw2(span<Circle>(arr));  // deduce the number of elements
    draw2(arr);    // deduce the element type and array size

    void draw3(span<Shape>);
    draw3(arr);    // error: cannot convert Circle[10] to span<Shape>

This `draw2()` passes the same amount of information to `draw()`, but makes the fact that it is supposed to be a range of `Circle`s explicit. See ???.

##### Exception

Use `zstring` and `czstring` to represent a C-style, zero-terminated strings.
But when doing so, use `string_span` from the [GSL](#GSL) to prevent range errors.

##### Enforcement

* (Simple) ((Bounds)) Warn for any expression that would rely on implicit conversion of an array type to a pointer type. Allow exception for zstring/czstring pointer types.
* (Simple) ((Bounds)) Warn for any arithmetic operation on an expression of pointer type that results in a value of pointer type. Allow exception for zstring/czstring pointer types.

### <a name="Ri-global-init"></a>I.22: Avoid complex initialization of global objects

##### Reason

Complex initialization can lead to undefined order of execution.

##### Example

    // file1.c

    extern const X x;

    const Y y = f(x);   // read x; write y

    // file2.c

    extern const Y y;

    const X x = g(y);   // read y; write x

Since `x` and `y` are in different translation units the order of calls to `f()` and `g()` is undefined;
one will access an uninitialized `const`.
This shows that the order-of-initialization problem for global (namespace scope) objects is not limited to global *variables*.

##### Note

Order of initialization problems become particularly difficult to handle in concurrent code.
It is usually best to avoid global (namespace scope) objects altogether.

##### Enforcement

* Flag initializers of globals that call non-`constexpr` functions
* Flag initializers of globals that access `extern` objects

### <a name="Ri-nargs"></a>I.23: Keep the number of function arguments low

##### Reason

Having many arguments opens opportunities for confusion. Passing lots of arguments is often costly compared to alternatives.

##### Discussion

The two most common reasons why functions have too many parameters are:

    1. *Missing an abstraction.* There is an abstraction missing, so that a compound value is being
    passed as individual elements instead of as a single object that enforces an invariant.
    This not only expands the parameter list, but it leads to errors because the component values
    are no longer protected by an enforced invariant.

    2. *Violating "one function, one responsibility."* The function is trying to do more than one
    job and should probably be refactored.

##### Example

The standard-library `merge()` is at the limit of what we can comfortably handle:

    template<class InputIterator1, class InputIterator2, class OutputIterator, class Compare>
    OutputIterator merge(InputIterator1 first1, InputIterator1 last1,
                         InputIterator2 first2, InputIterator2 last2,
                         OutputIterator result, Compare comp);

Note that this is because of problem 1 above -- missing abstraction. Instead of passing a range (abstraction), STL passed iterator pairs (unencapsulated component values).

Here, we have four template arguments and six function arguments.
To simplify the most frequent and simplest uses, the comparison argument can be defaulted to `<`:

    template<class InputIterator1, class InputIterator2, class OutputIterator>
    OutputIterator merge(InputIterator1 first1, InputIterator1 last1,
                         InputIterator2 first2, InputIterator2 last2,
                         OutputIterator result);

This doesn't reduce the total complexity, but it reduces the surface complexity presented to many users.
To really reduce the number of arguments, we need to bundle the arguments into higher-level abstractions:

    template<class InputRange1, class InputRange2, class OutputIterator>
    OutputIterator merge(InputRange1 r1, InputRange2 r2, OutputIterator result);

Grouping arguments into "bundles" is a general technique to reduce the number of arguments and to increase the opportunities for checking.

Alternatively, we could use concepts (as defined by the ISO TS) to define the notion of three types that must be usable for merging:

    Mergeable{In1 In2, Out}
    OutputIterator merge(In1 r1, In2 r2, Out result);

##### Example

The safety Profiles recommend replacing

    void f(int* some_ints, int some_ints_length);  // BAD: C style, unsafe

with

    void f(gsl::span<int> some_ints);              // GOOD: safe, bounds-checked

Here, using an abstraction has safety and robustness benefits, and naturally also reduces the number of parameters.

##### Note

How many parameters are too many? Try to use fewer than four (4) parameters.
There are functions that are best expressed with four individual parameters, but not many.

**Alternative**: Use better abstraction: Group arguments into meaningful objects and pass the objects (by value or by reference).

**Alternative**: Use default arguments or overloads to allow the most common forms of calls to be done with fewer arguments.

##### Enforcement

* Warn when a function declares two iterators (including pointers) of the same type instead of a range or a view.
* (Not enforceable) This is a philosophical guideline that is infeasible to check directly.

### <a name="Ri-unrelated"></a>I.24: Avoid adjacent unrelated parameters of the same type

##### Reason

Adjacent arguments of the same type are easily swapped by mistake.

##### Example, bad

Consider:

    void copy_n(T* p, T* q, int n);  // copy from [p:p+n) to [q:q+n)

This is a nasty variant of a K&R C-style interface. It is easy to reverse the "to" and "from" arguments.

Use `const` for the "from" argument:

    void copy_n(const T* p, T* q, int n);  // copy from [p:p+n) to [q:q+n)

##### Exception

If the order of the parameters is not important, there is no problem:

    int max(int a, int b);

##### Alternative

Don't pass arrays as pointers, pass an object representing a range (e.g., a `span`):

    void copy_n(span<const T> p, span<T> q);  // copy from p to q

##### Alternative

Define a `struct` as the parameter type and name the fields for those parameters accordingly:

    struct SystemParams {
        string config_file;
        string output_path;
        seconds timeout;
    };
    void initialize(SystemParams p);

This tends to make invocations of this clear to future readers, as the parameters
are often filled in by name at the call site.

##### Enforcement

(Simple) Warn if two consecutive parameters share the same type.

### <a name="Ri-abstract"></a>I.25: Prefer abstract classes as interfaces to class hierarchies

##### Reason

Abstract classes are more likely to be stable than base classes with state.

##### Example, bad

You just knew that `Shape` would turn up somewhere :-)

    class Shape {  // bad: interface class loaded with data
    public:
        Point center() const { return c; }
        virtual void draw() const;
        virtual void rotate(int);
        // ...
    private:
        Point c;
        vector<Point> outline;
        Color col;
    };

This will force every derived class to compute a center -- even if that's non-trivial and the center is never used. Similarly, not every `Shape` has a `Color`, and many `Shape`s are best represented without an outline defined as a sequence of `Point`s. Abstract classes were invented to discourage users from writing such classes:

    class Shape {    // better: Shape is a pure interface
    public:
        virtual Point center() const = 0;   // pure virtual function
        virtual void draw() const = 0;
        virtual void rotate(int) = 0;
        // ...
        // ... no data members ...
    };

##### Enforcement

(Simple) Warn if a pointer/reference to a class `C` is assigned to a pointer/reference to a base of `C` and the base class contains data members.

### <a name="Ri-abi"></a>I.26: If you want a cross-compiler ABI, use a C-style subset

##### Reason

Different compilers implement different binary layouts for classes, exception handling, function names, and other implementation details.

##### Exception

You can carefully craft an interface using a few carefully selected higher-level C++ types. See ???.

##### Exception

Common ABIs are emerging on some platforms freeing you from the more draconian restrictions.

##### Note

If you use a single compiler, you can use full C++ in interfaces. That may require recompilation after an upgrade to a new compiler version.

##### Enforcement

(Not enforceable) It is difficult to reliably identify where an interface forms part of an ABI.
