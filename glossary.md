A relatively informal definition of terms used in the guidelines
(based of the glossary in [Programming: Principles and Practice using C++](http://www.stroustrup.com/programming.html))

More information on many topics about C++ can be found on the [Standard C++ Foundation](https://isocpp.org)'s site. 

* *ABI*: Application Binary Interface, a specification for a specific hardware platform combined with the operating system. Contrast with API.
* *abstract class*: a class that cannot be directly used to create objects; often used to define an interface to derived classes.
  A class is made abstract by having a pure virtual function or only protected constructors.
* *abstraction*: a description of something that selectively and deliberately ignores (hides) details (e.g., implementation details); selective ignorance.
* *address*: a value that allows us to find an object in a computer's memory.
* *algorithm*: a procedure or formula for solving a problem; a finite series of computational steps to produce a result.
* *alias*: an alternative way of referring to an object; often a name, pointer, or reference.
* *API*: Application Programming Interface, a set of methods that form the communication between various software components. Contrast with ABI.
* *application*: a program or a collection of programs that is considered an entity by its users.
* *approximation*: something (e.g., a value or a design) that is close to the perfect or ideal (value or design).
  Often an approximation is a result of trade-offs among ideals.
* *argument*: a value passed to a function or a template, in which it is accessed through a parameter.
* *array*: a homogeneous sequence of elements, usually numbered, e.g., \[0:max).
* *assertion*: a statement inserted into a program to state (assert) that something must always be true at this point in the program.
* *base class*: a class used as the base of a class hierarchy. Typically a base class has one or more virtual functions.
* *bit*: the basic unit of information in a computer. A bit can have the value 0 or the value 1.
* *bug*: an error in a program.
* *byte*: the basic unit of addressing in most computers. Typically, a byte holds 8 bits.
* *class*: a user-defined type that may contain data members, function members, and member types.
* *code*: a program or a part of a program; ambiguously used for both source code and object code.
* *compiler*: a program that turns source code into object code.
* *complexity*: a hard-to-precisely-define notion or measure of the difficulty of constructing a solution to a problem or of the solution itself.
  Sometimes complexity is used to (simply) mean an estimate of the number of operations needed to execute an algorithm.
* *computation*: the execution of some code, usually taking some input and producing some output.
* *concept*: (1) a notion, and idea; (2) a set of requirements, usually for a template argument.
* *concrete class*: class for which objects can be created.
* *constant*: a value that cannot be changed (in a given scope); not mutable.
* *constructor*: an operation that initializes ("constructs") an object.
  Typically a constructor establishes an invariant and often acquires resources needed for an object to be used (which are then typically released by a destructor).
* *container*: an object that holds elements (other objects).
* *copy*: an operation that makes two object have values that compare equal. See also move.
* *correctness*: a program or a piece of a program is correct if it meets its specification.
  Unfortunately, a specification can be incomplete or inconsistent, or can fail to meet users' reasonable expectations.
  Thus, to produce acceptable code, we sometimes have to do more than just follow the formal specification.
* *cost*: the expense (e.g., in programmer time, run time, or space) of producing a program or of executing it.
  Ideally, cost should be a function of complexity.
* *customization point*: ???
* *data*: values used in a computation.
* *debugging*: the act of searching for and removing errors from a program; usually far less systematic than testing.
* *declaration*: the specification of a name with its type in a program.
* *definition*: a declaration of an entity that supplies all information necessary to complete a program using the entity.
  Simplified definition: a declaration that allocates memory.
* *derived class*: a class derived from one or more base classes.
* *design*: an overall description of how a piece of software should operate to meet its specification.
* *destructor*: an operation that is implicitly invoked (called) when an object is destroyed (e.g., at the end of a scope). Often, it releases resources.
* *encapsulation*: protecting something meant to be private (e.g., implementation details) from unauthorized access.
* *error*: a mismatch between reasonable expectations of program behavior (often expressed as a requirement or a users' guide) and what a program actually does.
* *executable*: a program ready to be run (executed) on a computer.
* *feature creep*: a tendency to add excess functionality to a program "just in case."
* *file*: a container of permanent information in a computer.
* *floating-point number*: a computer's approximation of a real number, such as 7.93 and 10.78e-3.
* *function*: a named unit of code that can be invoked (called) from different parts of a program; a logical unit of computation.
* *generic programming*: a style of programming focused on the design and efficient implementation of algorithms.
  A generic algorithm will work for all argument types that meet its requirements. In C++, generic programming typically uses templates.
* *global variable*: technically, a named object in namespace scope.
* *handle*: a class that allows access to another through a member pointer or reference. See also resource, copy, move.
* *header*: a file containing declarations used to share interfaces between parts of a program.
* *hiding*: the act of preventing a piece of information from being directly seen or accessed.
  For example, a name from a nested (inner) scope can prevent that same name from an outer (enclosing) scope from being directly used.
* *ideal*: the perfect version of something we are striving for. Usually we have to make trade-offs and settle for an approximation.
* *implementation*: (1) the act of writing and testing code; (2) the code that implements a program.
* *infinite loop*: a loop where the termination condition never becomes true. See iteration.
* *infinite recursion*: a recursion that doesn't end until the machine runs out of memory to hold the calls.
  In reality, such recursion is never infinite but is terminated by some hardware error.
* *information hiding*: the act of separating interface and implementation, thus hiding implementation details not meant for the user's attention and providing an abstraction.
* *initialize*: giving an object its first (initial) value.
* *input*: values used by a computation (e.g., function arguments and characters typed on a keyboard).
* *integer*: a whole number, such as 42 and -99.
* *interface*: a declaration or a set of declarations specifying how a piece of code (such as a function or a class) can be called.
* *invariant*: something that must be always true at a given point (or points) of a program; typically used to describe the state (set of values) of an object or the state of a loop before entry into the repeated statement.
* *iteration*: the act of repeatedly executing a piece of code; see recursion.
* *iterator*: an object that identifies an element of a sequence.
* *ISO*: International Organization for Standardization. The C++ language is an ISO standard, ISO/IEC 14882. More information at [iso.org](iso.org).
* *library*: a collection of types, functions, classes, etc. implementing a set of facilities (abstractions) meant to be potentially used as part of more that one program.
* *lifetime*: the time from the initialization of an object until it becomes unusable (goes out of scope, is deleted, or the program terminates).
* *linker*: a program that combines object code files and libraries into an executable program.
* *literal*: a notation that directly specifies a value, such as 12 specifying the integer value "twelve."
* *loop*: a piece of code executed repeatedly; in C++, typically a for-statement or a while-statement.

* *overload*: defining two functions or operators with the same name but different argument (operand) types.
* *override*: defining a function in a derived class with the same name and argument types as a virtual function in the base class, thus making the function callable through the interface defined by the base class.
* *owner*: an object responsible for releasing a resource.
* *paradigm*: a somewhat pretentious term for design or programming style; often used with the (erroneous) implication that there exists a paradigm that is superior to all others.
* *parameter*: a declaration of an explicit input to a function or a template. When called, a function can access the arguments passed through the names of its parameters.
* *pointer*: (1) a value used to identify a typed object in memory; (2) a variable holding such a value.

A Technical Specification is published for immediate use, but it also provides a means to obtain feedback. The aim is that it will eventually be transformed and republished as an International Standard.
