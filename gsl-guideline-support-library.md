# <span id="S-gsl"></span>GSL: Guideline support library

The GSL is a small library of facilities designed to support this set of guidelines.
Without these facilities, the guidelines would have to be far more restrictive on language details.

The Core Guidelines support library is defined in namespace `gsl` and the names may be aliases for standard library or other well-known library names. Using the (compile-time) indirection through the `gsl` namespace allows for experimentation and for local variants of the support facilities.

The GSL is header only, and can be found at [GSL: Guideline support library](https://github.com/Microsoft/GSL).
The support library facilities are designed to be extremely lightweight (zero-overhead) so that they impose no overhead compared to using conventional alternatives.
Where desirable, they can be "instrumented" with additional functionality (e.g., checks) for tasks such as debugging.

These Guidelines assume a `variant` type, but this is not currently in GSL.
Eventually, use [the one voted into C++17](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0088r3.html).

Summary of GSL components:

* [GSL.view: Views](#SS-views)
* [GSL.owner](#SS-ownership)
* [GSL.assert: Assertions](#SS-assertions)
* [GSL.util: Utilities](#SS-utilities)
* [GSL.concept: Concepts](#SS-gsl-concepts)

We plan for a "ISO C++ standard style" semi-formal specification of the GSL.

We rely on the ISO C++ standard library and hope for parts of the GSL to be absorbed into the standard library.

## <span id="SS-views"></span>GSL.view: Views

These types allow the user to distinguish between owning and non-owning pointers and between pointers to a single object and pointers to the first element of a sequence.

These "views" are never owners.

References are never owners. Note: References have many opportunities to outlive the objects they refer to (returning a local variable by reference, holding a reference to an element of a vector and doing `push_back`, binding to `std::max(x,y+1)`, etc. The Lifetime safety profile aims to address those things, but even so `owner<T&>` does not make sense and is discouraged.

The names are mostly ISO standard-library style (lower case and underscore):

* `T*`      // The `T*` is not an owner, may be null; assumed to be pointing to a single element.
* `T&`      // The `T&` is not an owner and can never be a "null reference"; references are always bound to objects.

The "raw-pointer" notation (e.g. `int*`) is assumed to have its most common meaning; that is, a pointer points to an object, but does not own it.
Owners should be converted to resource handles (e.g., `unique_ptr` or `vector<T>`) or marked `owner<T*>`.

* `owner<T*>`   // a `T*` that owns the object pointed/referred to; may be `nullptr`.

`owner` is used to mark owning pointers in code that cannot be upgraded to use proper resource handles.
Reasons for that include:

* Cost of conversion.
* The pointer is used with an ABI.
* The pointer is part of the implementation of a resource handle.

An `owner<T>` differs from a resource handle for a `T` by still requiring an explicit `delete`.

An `owner<T>` is assumed to refer to an object on the free store (heap).

If something is not supposed to be `nullptr`, say so:

* `not_null<T>`   // `T` is usually a pointer type (e.g., `not_null<int*>` and `not_null<owner<Foo*>>`) that may not be `nullptr`.
  `T` can be any type for which `==nullptr` is meaningful.

* `span<T>`       // `[`p`:`p+n`)`, constructor from `{p, q}` and `{p, n}`; `T` is the pointer type
* `span_p<T>`     // `{p, predicate}` \[`p`:`q`) where `q` is the first element for which `predicate(*p)` is true
* `string_span`   // `span<char>`
* `cstring_span`  // `span<const char>`

A `span<T>` refers to zero or more mutable `T`s unless `T` is a `const` type.

"Pointer arithmetic" is best done within `span`s.
A `char*` that points to more than one `char` but is not a C-style string (e.g., a pointer into an input buffer) should be represented by a `span`.

* `zstring`    // a `char*` supposed to be a C-style string; that is, a zero-terminated sequence of `char` or `nullptr`
* `czstring`   // a `const char*` supposed to be a C-style string; that is, a zero-terminated sequence of `const` `char` or `nullptr`

Logically, those last two aliases are not needed, but we are not always logical, and they make the distinction between a pointer to one `char` and a pointer to a C-style string explicit.
A sequence of characters that is not assumed to be zero-terminated should be a `char*`, rather than a `zstring`.
French accent optional.

Use `not_null<zstring>` for C-style strings that cannot be `nullptr`. ??? Do we need a name for `not_null<zstring>`? or is its ugliness a feature?

## <span id="SS-ownership"></span>GSL.owner: Ownership pointers

* `unique_ptr<T>`     // unique ownership: `std::unique_ptr<T>`
* `shared_ptr<T>`     // shared ownership: `std::shared_ptr<T>` (a counted pointer)
* `stack_array<T>`    // A stack-allocated array. The number of elements are determined at construction and fixed thereafter. The elements are mutable unless `T` is a `const` type.
* `dyn_array<T>`      // ??? needed ??? A heap-allocated array. The number of elements are determined at construction and fixed thereafter.
  The elements are mutable unless `T` is a `const` type. Basically a `span` that allocates and owns its elements.

## <span id="SS-assertions"></span>GSL.assert: Assertions

* `Expects`     // precondition assertion. Currently placed in function bodies. Later, should be moved to declarations.
                // `Expects(p)` terminates the program unless `p == true`
                // `Expect` in under control of some options (enforcement, error message, alternatives to terminate)
* `Ensures`     // postcondition assertion. Currently placed in function bodies. Later, should be moved to declarations.

These assertions is currently macros (yuck!) and must appear in function definitions (only)
pending standard commission decisions on contracts and assertion syntax.
See [the contract proposal](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0380r1.pdf); using the attribute syntax,
for example, `Expects(p!=nullptr)` will become `[[expects: p!=nullptr]]`.

## <span id="SS-utilities"></span>GSL.util: Utilities

* `finally`       // `finally(f)` makes a `final_action{f}` with a destructor that invokes `f`
* `narrow_cast`   // `narrow_cast<T>(x)` is `static_cast<T>(x)`
* `narrow`        // `narrow<T>(x)` is `static_cast<T>(x)` if `static_cast<T>(x) == x` or it throws `narrowing_error`
* `[[implicit]]`  // "Marker" to put on single-argument constructors to explicitly make them non-explicit.
* `move_owner`    // `p = move_owner(q)` means `p = q` but ???

## <span id="SS-gsl-concepts"></span>GSL.concept: Concepts

These concepts (type predicates) are borrowed from
Andrew Sutton's Origin library,
the Range proposal,
and the ISO WG21 Palo Alto TR.
They are likely to be very similar to what will become part of the ISO C++ standard.
The notation is that of the ISO WG21 [Concepts TS](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/n4553.pdf).
Most of the concepts below are defined in [the Ranges TS](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/n4569.pdf).

* `Range`
* `String`   // ???
* `Number`   // ???
* `Sortable`
* `Pointer`  // A type with `*`, `->`, `==`, and default construction (default construction is assumed to set the singular "null" value); see [smart pointers](#SS-gsl-smartptrconcepts)
* `Unique_ptr`  // A type that matches `Pointer`, has move (not copy), and matches the Lifetime profile criteria for a `unique` owner type; see [smart pointers](#SS-gsl-smartptrconcepts)
* `Shared_ptr`   // A type that matches `Pointer`, has copy, and matches the Lifetime profile criteria for a `shared` owner type; see [smart pointers](#SS-gsl-smartptrconcepts)
* `EqualityComparable`   // ???Must we suffer CaMelcAse???
* `Convertible`
* `Common`
* `Boolean`
* `Integral`
* `SignedIntegral`
* `SemiRegular` // ??? Copyable?
* `Regular`
* `TotallyOrdered`
* `Function`
* `RegularFunction`
* `Predicate`
* `Relation`
* ...
